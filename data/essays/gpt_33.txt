The novel “Into the Wild” by Jon Krakauer tells the true story of Christopher McCandless, a young man who abandoned his comfortable life to live off the land in the wilderness of Alaska. Overall, the protagonist has many qualities of a hero. However, it is up to interpretation whether these qualities are enough to make him a prototypical hero.

Firstly, Christopher displays immense bravery in his journey. Leaving behind everything he knew and stepping out into the wild on his own takes a lot of courage, particularly as he had no prior experience or knowledge of how to survive off the land. This is a key quality that heroes are often known for - their bravery in the face of adversity. Christopher also continued to pursue his dream of living in the wilderness, even when he faced numerous obstacles, including hunger, cold weather, and the physical challenges of surviving on his own.

Another quality that Christopher possesses is his determination. He never gave up on his dream, even when it became difficult. This determination and persistence show that he is willing to face challenges head-on and work towards his goals with unwavering commitment.

However, Christopher also possesses some negative qualities, such as his stubbornness and his tendency to turn away from the help of others. These traits ultimately cause him harm and contribute to his untimely death. A prototypical hero is selfless and always willing to help others, but this is not the case with Christopher.

In addition, Christopher’s lack of preparation for his journey shows a level of naivety that is often not associated with a hero. Although he had good intentions, he placed himself in danger by not being adequately equipped with the necessary knowledge and resources needed to survive in the wild. A typical hero would be expected to have some level of knowledge and preparation before embarking on such a perilous journey.

In conclusion, Christopher McCandless displays many heroic qualities throughout the novel “Into the Wild,” including bravery and determination. However, his negative traits, lack of preparedness, and failure to help others prevent him from being a prototypical hero. While he may have met his untimely demise, McCandless' journey will continue to inspire readers to live life on their own terms and pursue their dreams with unyielding determination, while also serving as a warning of the dangers of reckless decisions.
