Main character Stephen’s Irish nationality influences him in the novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce. Nationalism and politics confuses him as a child. He questions his Irish identity due to this confusion. His experience in a Catholic school results in him questioning his religion, As Catholicism is Ireland’s national religion, his religion is heavily linked to his sense of national identity, and his rebelling against these is a central foundation of his personality.
Stephen questions his Irishness from the outset. He listens to an argument between his family members  about what a priest’s role in politics is: “Nobody is saying a word against them, said Mr Dedalus, so long as they don’t meddle in politics,” he hears. “Let them leave politics alone, said Mr Casey, or the people may leave their church alone.” (20) He hears in rebuttal. The politics of being Irish confuse him, resulting in him questioning his Irish identity.
Stephen’s alienating experience in a Catholic school also causes him to question his identity. The long sermons fill him with humility and shame, and he is plagued with “restless feeling of guilt.” (82) He has an unfair interaction with a priest. He “broke his glasses,” (33) excusing him from work. The priest calls him a “lazy little schemer,” a “lazy idle little loafer,” and he suffers corporal punishment. This punishment contributes to his alienation from Catholicism as a whole, as he sees many of its rules and practices as unfair. 

	The result of his alienating experience causes him to rebel.

In conclusion, his lack of understanding with politics and his alienating experience in a Catholic school causes him to doubt his identity.
