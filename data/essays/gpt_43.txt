Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell is a masterful novel that spans multiple timelines, genres, and settings, weaving together various narrative threads that ultimately culminate into a breathtaking masterpiece. Arguably the most fascinating aspect of this novel is the way in which the first four stories are interlinked and connected. It is through these connections that Mitchell shows the continuation of certain themes and ideas across time and space, ultimately creating a beautifully intricate web of ideas and symbols that make Cloud Atlas unforgettable.

The thematic purpose of the connection between the first four stories is to show how these seemingly disparate tales are all interconnected, depicting the cyclical nature of human existence. At first glance, the stories appear to have nothing in common, but gradually, the reader begins to realize the similarities and connections between each one. For instance, in each narrative, the protagonist is fighting against some form of oppressive force, whether it be a person, corporation, or government. Additionally, each story explores the larger themes of power, love, and the meaning of existence.

Moreover, Mitchell's impressive use of intertextuality is what makes each of these narratives feel essential to the overarching plotline of the novel. Characters, motifs, and themes are repeated throughout the stories, and by doing so, Mitchell extends the novel's themes across different periods of time. In this way, he creates his own form of literary intertextuality, which is unique to Cloud Atlas.

Overall, Mitchell effectively connects each narrative to illustrate the oneness of humanity. His message is clear: while the settings and characters may change, there remains a cyclical nature to our existence that is beyond measure. By repeating themes, symbols, and motifs between each of the stories, Mitchell is able to create a sense of unity that permeates the entire novel. Ultimately, the connection between the stories of Cloud Atlas is not gimmicky but serves a grander purpose, presenting the reader with a unified vision of human existence that no single tale could ever accomplish on its own. Mitchell's interlinking of the first four stories is what makes Cloud Atlas not only a captivating read but also a profound examination of the human experience.
