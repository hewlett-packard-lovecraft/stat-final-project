Umberto Eco's essay "Ur-Fascism" defines fascism as a complex ideology that arises from an individual or group's need for unity, authority, and tradition. Eco notes that fascism typically presents itself as a "third way" between capitalism and communism, and as such, often draws upon elements of both ideologies. Eco also identifies more specific features of fascism, such as the rejection of critical thinking and the elevation of emotion over reason, the emphasis on the superiority of one's own race or nation, the cultivation of a cult of heroism and violence, and the use of propaganda and censorship to create a sense of unity and control. Overall, Eco argues that fascism is a dangerous and insidious ideology that poses a threat to democracy and individual freedoms.
