The Epistolary format used in Stephen King's novel Carrie allows the reader to see into the mind of Carrie, without resorting to first person view. Carrie’s feelings are described with testimonials and newspaper clippings from after the event are inserted throughout the book as the events occur. For example, testimonials from witnesses give guesses to what Carrie may be thinking, which the reader can cross reference with the events of the book to see into Carrie’s mind. Expert commentary is also used. For example, the book The Shadow Exploded is constantly used to inform the reader.  By giving the reader information about Carrie and what happens after the events of the book, King is able to represent the thoughts and feelings of Carrie.
