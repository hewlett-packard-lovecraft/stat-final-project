In Jon Krakauerâ€™s novel, Into The Wild, Christopher McCandless is portrayed as a hero with unique qualities that set him apart from traditional figures of heroism. Although Christopher may not fit the conventional criteria of a hero, his nonconformity, bravery, and selflessness make him worthy of the title.

Firstly, Christopher exemplifies nonconformity. He chooses to live a life that is unconventional, rejecting many of the values and traditions associated with modern society. Throughout the novel, Krakauer describes how Christopher longed to escape the constraints and pressures of his privileged upbringing in suburban Virginia and to experience a more profound connection with himself and with nature. His decision to leave all material possessions, cut ties with his family and friends, and venture out into the Alaskan wilderness on his own is a clear example of his nonconformist nature. This trait is a critical characteristic of a hero, as it takes considerable courage to stand up against the norm and to follow one's heart instead.

Secondly, Christopher exhibits bravery throughout the novel. His adventure into the unknown leaves him vulnerable to harsh environmental conditions, starvation, and physical harm. Despite these challenges, Christopher pushes on. As documented in the book, Christopher traversed rugged terrain, crossed through the dangerous rapids of the Colorado River, and even slept alone in the woods with nothing but a sleeping bag. All the while, his brave and adventurous spirit never failed. His exceptional endurance and resiliency in his quest for self-discovery are admirable qualities of heroism.

Lastly, Christopher possesses an innate selflessness that proves his heroic nature. Throughout his journey, he encounters people who become an important part of his life, and at times, jeopardize the very ideals he seeks to live by. Despite strong temptation, Christopher chooses not to compromise his beliefs and values. He instead chooses to remain true to his character and convictions.  His altruistic decision to offer his resources and companionship to those he meets on his journey, ultimately led to his own tragic and untimely end. An act of selflessness that is indicative of a hero.

In conclusion, while Christopher McCandless may not conform to the traditional standards of a hero, his unique qualities of nonconformity, bravery, and selflessness undoubtedly make him a prototypical hero. He sets his own standards for a meaningful existence, living his life on his terms with determination and courage. The example Christopher sets in Into The Wild can serve as a model for anyone seeking fulfillment and meaning in their lives despite the challenges they may face.
