In the novel In One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, the narrator, Chief Bromden, is an unreliable narrator who makes observations that are not always accurate. There are several instances in which his perceptions are skewed, particularly those related to his perception of McMurphy. Some reasons for Chief's unreliability include his mental illness, his drug use, and his fear of the hospital staff.

Firstly, Chief Bromden's mental illness makes him an unreliable narrator. He suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, which affects his perceptions of reality. He often sees things that are not there and hears voices that no one else can hear. For example, he believes that the hospital is a mechanical and oppressive institution that controls its patients through a system of wires and machinery. This belief is not rooted in reality but rather in his delusions.

Secondly, Chief Bromden's drug use contributes to his unreliability. Throughout the novel, he takes medication to control his mental illness. This medication has side effects that can alter his perceptions of reality. For instance, he experiences hallucinations and vivid dreams that blur the line between reality and fantasy. These experiences make it difficult for him to distinguish between what is real and what is not.

Finally, Chief Bromden's fear of the hospital staff also makes him an unreliable narrator. He is constantly afraid of being caught and punished by the hospital staff, and this fear affects his perceptions of McMurphy. He sees McMurphy as a powerful and heroic figure who is standing up against the oppressive system of the hospital. However, this perception is colored by his fear of the staff and his desire to see a savior figure who can rescue him from his situation.

In conclusion, Chief Bromden is an unreliable narrator who makes observations that are not always accurate. His mental illness, drug use, and fear of the hospital staff all contribute to his unreliability. In particular, his perception of McMurphy is colored by his desire for a savior and his fear of the staff. Therefore, readers should approach Chief's observations with caution and consider the context in which they are made.
