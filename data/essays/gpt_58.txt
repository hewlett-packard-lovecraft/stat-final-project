A fish would be more efficient at passing on energy to the next trophic level compared to a mammal. This is because fish are cold-blooded animals, which means they do not need to use energy to regulate their body temperature. Therefore, when fish consume food, more of the energy obtained from the food is available to be passed on to the next level. Additionally, fish have a simpler digestive system compared to mammals, which allows for a more efficient conversion of food into energy. On the other hand, mammals use energy to maintain their body temperature, have a more complex digestive system, and need to use energy to support their larger body mass, resulting in a lower efficiency in transferring energy to the next trophic level.
