The central meaning behind the story of Sonmi-451 in Cloud Atlas is the exploration of power structures and the nature of oppression in society. Sonmi-451 represents the marginalized and oppressed, and her rebellion against the ruling authority brings to light the ways in which power and control can be used to suppress certain groups of people. The story is similar to other dystopian works in that it portrays an imagined future society that is oppressive and authoritarian. However, unlike other works, the depiction of oppression in Cloud Atlas is nuanced, showing the complex nature of power dynamics and the ways in which individuals can resist and fight against them.
