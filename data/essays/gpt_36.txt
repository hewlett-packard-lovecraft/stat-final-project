In Arthur Miller's play, "Death of a Salesman," the motivations of the central characters are complex and interconnected. The four main characters are Willy Loman, a traveling salesman; his wife, Linda; and their two sons, Biff and Happy. Throughout the play, the motivations of each character become increasingly intertwined, leading to moments of tension, conflict, and deep emotion.

Willy Loman's primary motivation is to achieve the American Dream of wealth, success, and popularity. He believes that being liked and popular is the key to success in business and life. He is desperate to be remembered and respected, and he is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve this goal, including lying and manipulating. Willy's fear of failure and his deep-seated insecurities drive him to cling to his delusions, and his inability to accept reality ultimately leads to his tragic downfall.

Linda Loman's motivation is to protect her family. Throughout the play, she supports her husband, even when she knows he is lying to himself and his family. She is loyal to her family and constantly reminds them of the importance of their shared love and emotional connections. Linda's strength and resilience serve as a counterbalance to Willy's anxieties and insecurities.

Biff Loman's motivation is to find his identity and purpose in life. He is struggling to find his place in the world and is haunted by his father's expectations. As a young man, Biff idolized his father, but as he grew older, he began to recognize Willy's faults and lies. Biff's disillusionment with his father and his own failures drive him to confront his past and seek a new path in life.

Happy Loman's motivation is to live up to his father's expectations and succeed in business. Unlike Biff, Happy is content with his life and believes that he can achieve success by following his father's advice and tactics. He is willing to compromise his values to get ahead, and he is often blind to the flaws in his family and his own life.

The motivations of the four central characters are intertwined and interconnected. Willy's fear of failure and his desperate desire for success and popularity drive him to cling to his delusions, which not only harm himself but also his family. Linda's loyalty to her family and her love for her husband are pitted against her realization that Willy's dreams are unrealistic and harmful. Biff and Happy's struggles with their own identity and their relationship with their father drive the plot and reveal the tragic consequences of the American Dream. Ultimately, the characters in "Death of a Salesman" are linked by their shared struggles and motivations, which ultimately lead to the play's tragic end.
