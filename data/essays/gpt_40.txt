The epistolary format in "Carrie" allows the reader to see the inner thoughts and motivations of characters other than just Carrie. The use of letters, diary entries, and news articles helps build the paranoia and revenge themes as we see characters' perspectives and reactions to Carrie's powers. Through these various forms of first-person accounts, we get a sense of Carrie's inner turmoil and emotions, even though we never actually get her authentic perspective. The different voices and perspectives help showcase the impact that Carrie's actions have had on those around her, ultimately leading to the novel's tragic conclusion.
