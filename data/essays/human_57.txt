A Moment in Time
Coal smoke hangs in the air,
Black mist over the city’s fare.
Heat beats down behind its veil,
Stifling the scene below.
Horses speed through the streets
-Carriages right behind,
While the people mill
Through the throng,
Buttoned boots on cobbled floor.
Faces twisting in revulsion,
Handkerchiefs over noses,
They gag at the stink,
From the ghastly Thames,
Where soured gunk arouses.
The lingering smoke
And the dreadful heat
Mingling with the river’s dung,
A saline tang
Beneath it all
Choking all those below.
Swinging skirts and wilted shirts
Pushing through the throng,
Another day in London,
1858.
