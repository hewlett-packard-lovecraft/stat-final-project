Arthur Miller's famous play, "Death of a Salesman," centers around the character of Willy Loman, a struggling salesman nearing the end of his life. The play is also home to other central characters, who each play an essential role in the story. In this essay, I'll examine the motivations of four central characters of the play, particularly Willy Loman, Biff Loman, Happy Loman, and Linda Loman. I will determine if their motivations are linked or separate.

To begin, Willy Loman's primary motivation is to provide for his family and give them a better life. As a salesman, he is determined to be successful and become a well-respected man in society. However, as he becomes older and his sales begin to decline, he begins to question the success he has achieved in his life. Willy's motivation is somewhat linked to Biff's, his eldest son. Biff was a popular football athlete in high school, and Willy believed that he had a bright future ahead of him. With his heart set on Biff becoming successful, Willy invests all his hope in his son, despite Biff's disinterest in the idea. When Biff abandons his goals and ambitions, Willy's motivation crumbles, and he becomes increasingly distraught.

Biff Loman, on the other hand, has a different motivation for his life. Biff wants to disconnect from his father and begin a new life on his terms. Despite his father's high hopes for him, Biff feels like a failure because he never accomplished anything significant in his life. His motivation is to rid himself of his expectations and live a simple and honest life.

Happy Loman's motivation is focused entirely on his success as a salesman. Unlike his brother, Happy does not wish to disengage himself from his father or take a life of his own. Happy is content with his job and is passionate about his success as a salesman, just like his father. He also views himself as a lady's man and is chasing after a married woman, which is a source of tension in the story.

Lastly, Linda's motivation is to protect and support her family despite their constant hardships and struggles. Linda is the voice of reason in the play, who tries to keep the family together as they go through difficult times. Her primary motivation is to love and care for her family, which she does unconditionally.

In conclusion, the four central characters of the play "Death of a Salesman" all have separate motivations. Willy Loman and Biff Loman's motivations are somewhat linked but differ in their desires for success. Happy Loman's motivation is entirely different from his family members, and he's more focused on his career. Linda Loman cares primarily about her family and ensuring that they stay together through their struggles. Understanding these characters' motivations is crucial in understanding the story's central conflict, which revolves around the American Dream, masculinity, and familial expectations.
