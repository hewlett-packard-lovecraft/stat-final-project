In J.M. Coetzee's novel Disgrace, David Lurie is a middle-aged communications professor who exploits his power both as a teacher and as a white man in Apartheid-era South Africa. Through his actions and interactions with key players in the novel, particularly Melanie, Soraya, and Polley, the reader is able to gain insight into the ways in which Lurie abuses his power and privilege.

Firstly, as a teacher, Lurie exploits his power over Melanie, one of his students. In the early stages of the novel, we see Lurie initiating an affair with Melanie despite the obvious power imbalance between them. Lurie is dismissive of Melanie's request to read Byron as part of the course material and soon thereafter, proceeds to initiate sexual contact with her. Moreover, he rationalizes his behavior by implying that Melanie is complicit in the relationship, leading to the notion that he is using his power as an older man and a teacher to take advantage of her.

Secondly, as a white man, Lurie exploits his power over two women, Soraya and Polley, early in the novel. When visiting Soraya, his ex-wife, Lurie takes advantage of her hospitality by having sex with her. Lurie later reiterates his questionable motives by declaring that the sex is purely physical and that he has no intentions of returning back to Soraya as a partner. Similarly, when Lurie meets Polley about getting his daughter Lucy's dog, he uses his position as a customer to make advances towards her, grooming her into a possible sexual encounter in the future.

Overall, Lurie's exploitation of his power as a white man and a professor in Apartheid-era South Africa highlights the inequalities that existed during that time period. The power imbalance between Lurie and Melanie, as well as his earlier behavior with Soraya and Polley, suggest that Lurie views women as objects who are there for his disposal. In conclusion, David Lurie's exploitation of his power in Disgrace serves as a typical example of the kind of complex issues at play in South Africa during that time period. Through his actions, Coetzee's work presents several resonant questions regarding power, race, gender, and responsibility that are still relevant to readers today.
