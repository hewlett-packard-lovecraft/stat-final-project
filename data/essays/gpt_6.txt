Life of Pi by Yann Martel is a story of a boy named Pi who is stranded at sea for 227 days with only a Bengal tiger for company. A key aspect of Pi's survival is his need for communication. To maintain his sanity and entertain himself, he journals his experience daily. Through his journaling, Pi conveys important lessons about the human need for communication.

First, Pi's journal highlights the importance of communication for keeping track of time. Pi uses his journal to mark the days he has spent on the boat and to commemorate important events that happen. When he does not have a way to measure time, he feels lost and hopeless. This shows that humans need communication to establish a sense of order and control in their lives.

Second, Pi's journal shows that communication is essential for processing emotions. In the beginning, he is scared, lonely, and homesick, but as he continues to journal, he gains a sense of peace and acceptance. He processes his emotions by exploring them in writing. Pi's journaling is a form of self-therapy, which allows him to process his experiences and emotions.

Third, Pi's journaling highlights the need for connection with others. Writing in his journal allows him to communicate with people he has left behind. He writes letters to his family and imagines their replies. This shows that human beings need communication to maintain relationships. Even when we are physically alone, we still seek interaction and connection.

Fourth, Pi's journaling conveys important themes about the human need for creativity and expression. Through his writing, Pi invents stories, poems, and even songs. He also uses creative thinking to solve problems and invent new ways to survive. This demonstrates that communication is not only essential for survival but also for personal growth and development.

Finally, Pi's journal highlights the importance of language and its ability to unify and connect people from different backgrounds. Pi speaks fluently and comfortably in three languages - English, French, and Tamil. He uses this ability to communicate with his animals, and this helps him connect with his surroundings. His language skills also reveal the universality and interconnectedness of human cultures.

In conclusion, Pi's journaling in Life of Pi reveals the importance of communication for basic survival as well as personal growth, relationship building, and developing a sense of identity. His constant need for communication shows that humans are inherently social beings and that we thrive on connectivity. By sharing his personal experience with journaling, Pi reminds us that communication is a fundamental aspect of humanity, without which, we would struggle to survive.
