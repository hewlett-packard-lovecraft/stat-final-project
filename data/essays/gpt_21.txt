In James Joyce's "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man," the protagonist, Stephen Dedalus, is heavily influenced by his Irish nationality and what it means to be Irish. Stephen experiences conflicting feelings about his nationality and struggles to come to terms with his place in Irish society. Throughout the novel, Stephen rebels against the limitations of being Irish and tries to establish his own identity.

Firstly, Stephen is deeply influenced by the religious and political atmosphere of Ireland. His Catholic upbringing and Irish nationalist sentiment form the backdrop of his childhood. Stephen is exposed to the ongoing conflicts and struggles of the Irish people and feels a sense of pride and responsibility for his country. However, Stephen quickly realizes the limitations and contradictions of Irish society. The politics, religion and social norms are all in direct conflict with his individuality and creativity, making him feel misplaced within his own culture.

Secondly, Stephen is conflicted about his Irish identity. On one hand, he feels a deep love and admiration for his homeland and its people. On the other hand, he feels constrained and repressed by the confines of Irish culture. Stephen often feels trapped by the narrow-mindedness and conformity of Irish society, leaving him feeling out of place. Stephen has great aspirations for his artistic life, but the conservative, provincial community that surrounds him does not allow him the freedom to thrive and create. 

Finally, Stephen ultimately rebels against his Irish identity altogether. He feels oppressed by the cultural, political, and social norms of his country and decides to renounce his nationalism entirely. He feels so constrained and held under such restrictions that he breaks free and leaves Ireland to pursue his artistic interests in Europe. Stephen hopes that by leaving Ireland, he can escape the restrictions that have hindered his creative growth as an artist. 

In conclusion, the Irish identity is an essential part of Stephen's character, which profoundly affects him throughout the novel. Stephen's struggle with his Irish identity is a recurring theme in the book. He experiences a love for his country but also recognizes the limitations and restraints placed upon him as an Irishman. Ultimately, Stephen's rebellion against his Irish nationality is his way of expressing his need for creative expression and a desire to be free of social constraints. Stephen's rebellion against the Irish identity is an essential aspect of his personal growth and journey towards self-discovery.
