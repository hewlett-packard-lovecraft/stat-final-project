In Bradbury’s story “The Pedestrian”, the light from Mr. Mead’s house is a symbol to the hope for
humanity. For instance, when the lights from other people’s houses are all blue lights the light
from Mr. Mead’s house is yellow light, which means that he does not have a TV at home. When
people are all sitting in front of the TV, they are cold like zombies as they don’t have any
communication with others. However, Mr. Mead has no TV at home, so he still keeps his bright
humanity. Another way to think about it is that the yellow light represents Mr. Mead’s creative
mind, which is another valuable humanity. When the others are brain washed by the things that
show on the TV, Mr. Mead is not brain washed and still keeps his creativity and have his own
thoughts. Another way to explain the light is that the blue light of TV disconnected the other
people from the environment. While these people are entertained by TV instead of the nature,
they lose the part of their humanity that is related to the nature. Nevertheless, Mr. Mead, who
doesn't have TV at home, is able to go for a night walk and maintain the part of his humanity
that relates him to the natural world. Overall, the light symbolise Mr. Mead’s bright, optimistic,
creative humanity as well as his basic humanity that comes from the nature.
