The wilderness holds a distinctive appeal to the various adventure-seekers in Jon Krakauer's Into the Wild. The primary character Chris McCandless, as well as the diverse group of individuals he encounters on his journey, share a fascination and deep appreciation for the natural world. In particular, McCandless is enthralled by the raw, unadulterated essence of nature, and it is this aspect of the wilderness that draws him towards it.

First of all, McCandless's obsession with the wilderness is reflective of the romantic philosophy that he embraces. Similar to Transcendentalism, a literary and philosophical movement that emphasized the importance of personal integrity and living in harmony with nature, McCandless believes that nature offers salvation from societal ills. He deeply desires to experience nature in its rawest form, to get away from the corrupt, materialistic world he feels oppressed by, and to be in touch with his primitive spirit. McCandless's romanticized view of the natural world is evocative of his desire to escape from the hypocrisy of materialism.

Moreover, McCandless's enduring love for the wilderness is also an acknowledgement of his autonomous lifestyle. He prefers to be self-reliant and free from the constraints of civilisation. McCandless chooses to embark on his journey with equipment that would be considered inadequate by regular adventurists, as he wants to fully embrace the inherent risks of living off the land. He believes that facing these challenges of survival will make him stronger and enhance his connection with the environment. This appreciation for self-sufficiency is something that he shares with other characters in the novel like Wayne Westerberg, and Ron Franz, who are themselves seeking lives of freedom and independency.

Lastly, the wilderness holds a spiritual and transformative appeal for McCandless. When confronted by Alaska's beauty, McCandless experiences a change in his perception and transforms into a new person. His innermost psyche is touched and stirred by the magnificence and brutality of nature. He cherishes the wilderness's power to transform him by humbling him in ways that he never thought possible. This transformative quality of the wilderness is something that he shares with other characters in the novel. For instance, Ronald Franz and Gene Rossellini try to find solace in the wilderness following personal difficulties and crisis.

In conclusion, Chris McCandless's deep appreciation for the wilderness is grounded in his belief in the power of nature to rekindle the basic human spirit. As depicted in Krakauer's Into the Wild, the wilderness holds a profound adventurous appeal, not just to McCandless but also other characters he meets along the way. Different characters may have their reasons for seeking the wilds, but the underlying commonality among them is the wilderness's transformative power to alter their being.
