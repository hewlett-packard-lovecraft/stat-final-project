In J.M. Coetzeeâ€™s novel Disgrace, violence and oppression are central themes that shape the story and its characters. The novel portrays a society in which the power dynamics are unevenly skewed, with some individuals enjoying privileges at the expense of others. The author investigates the ways in which violence and oppression manifest themselves within the South African society, exposing how individuals embrace these practices to maintain their position in the society.

At the center of the novel are David Lurie, a middle-aged professor at a university in Cape Town, and his daughter, Lucy, who survive a brutal attack on their farmstead by three black assailants. The attack is the epitome of the violence and oppression that plague the South African society, where black individuals are discriminated against and subject to economic marginalization. The attackers' motives are unclear, but the fact that they are black men attacking white people is symbolic and suggestive of the larger societal issues of racism and prejudice that exist in the novel's setting.

David Lurie can be seen as the oppressor in the novel, representing the patriarchal white establishment that holds economic and political power. He exhibits this power dynamic in his sexually exploitative behavior towards women, particularly his affair with a student who instead of reporting the sexual misconduct was forced to resign from the university. Furthermore, his paternalistic attitude towards his daughter, Lucy, is invasive, oppressive and reinforces the power dynamic in their relationship, particularly when he disregards her independence and decision-making abilities.

Lucy, on the other hand, exemplifies the oppressed. She is a woman living in a male-dominated society where her agency is limited and her safety precarious. The attack on her farmstead symbolizes the constant threat of violence that women face in their daily lives. Lucy's decision to stay on the farm after the attack, to work her own land, is a response to this disparity in society as she seeks to reclaim her agency and independence. 

Direct comparisons can be drawn between the power dynamics behind the attack and the sexual exploitation that occurs earlier in the novel. In both cases, the oppressors are exploiting their position of power to impose their will on others. Nevertheless, Lucy's experience of being attacked cannot be compared to David's exploitation of his position of power. The former experience was a traumatic and dehumanizing ordeal that lasted only a few moments, while the latter is an ongoing systemic issue.

In conclusion, violence and oppression are central themes in Disgrace by J.M. Coetzee. The novel exposes the ways in which these tactics are employed to maintain power in the society. The oppressors and the oppressed are not clearly defined as characters in the novel, as both oppressors and oppressed are shown to exist in various categories. However, the author's depiction of these themes is compelling and serves as a commentary on the oppressive societal structures that exist within South African society.
