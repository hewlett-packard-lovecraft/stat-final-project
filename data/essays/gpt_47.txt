In the context of knowledge as justified true belief, there is an argument to be made for the establishment of a new form of knowledge. This new form of knowledge, which I believe many are still unaware of, is the practice of digital minimalism.

Digital minimalism is a philosophy that advocates for the intentional use of technology only in instances where it serves a specific purpose, rather than allowing it to take up a significant portion of our time and attention without any meaningful benefit. It entails breaking away from the constant need for digital stimulation and learning to cultivate more meaningful relationships, experiences, and pursuits in the physical world.

The justification for this belief stems from the increasing prevalence of addiction to technology and the negative impact it has on our mental and physical health. Studies have shown that excessive use of digital devices can increase levels of anxiety and depression and lead to a lack of focus and productivity.

In contrast, digital minimalism has been proven to reduce stress and increase well-being. It also promotes better time management, which allows for more time to pursue meaningful hobbies and interests, as well as more face-to-face interactions with loved ones.

Moreover, digital minimalism is not a practice aimed at completely eradicating technology from our lives but rather establishing a healthy relationship with it. By limiting our use, we can better appreciate the benefits that technology does provide without its harmful effects.

In conclusion, the digital age has brought about many positive changes to our lives, but it has also led to detrimental effects on our well-being. The establishment of digital minimalism as a form of knowledge is, therefore, necessary to ensure a healthier relationship between humans and technology. By adopting this practice, we can lead more fulfilling lives and be more connected to the world around us.
