Albert Camus’s The Stranger is a literary masterpiece that has captivated both readers and critics since its publication. The story chronicles the life of the protagonist, Meursault, who, after committing a seemingly inexplicable murder, is put on trial and sentenced to death. While awaiting execution, Meursault experiences a profound ‘revelation.’ However, the authenticity of this epiphany has been a topic of debate among scholars and readers. In this essay, I will argue that Meursault’s revelation is genuine and is not just a result of his fear over his impending death.

Firstly, it is essential to understand Meursault’s character and personality to comprehend the authenticity of his transformation. Meursault is a man who seems to be detached from the world around him – a man who is indifferent to his mother’s death and is indifferent to the fact that he killed a man. However, his indifference is not rooted in evil, but in his desire for authenticity and honesty. Thus, when Meursault experiences his ‘revelation,’ it is not because he is afraid to die, but because he has finally accepted the truth about the world and his place in it.

Secondly, Meursault’s revelation is evident in the way he begins to perceive the world around him. Before his epiphany, Meursault is a man who is indifferent to life – he does not have any aspirations or desires. However, after his transformation, Meursault appreciates even the simplest things in life, such as the smell of coffee, the warmth of the sun, and the sound of laughter. This transformation is not something that is forced but is an organic change that occurs within Meursault.

Thirdly, the authenticity of Meursault’s revelation is evident in the way he reacts to his impending execution. Meursault is not a man who fears death, nor is he a man who denies its inevitability. On the contrary, he accepts his fate with open arms and finds comfort in the fact that he will no longer have to live a life without meaning. This reaction shows that Meursault’s transformation is genuine and is not just a reaction to his fear of dying.

Moreover, Meursault’s revelation is an integral part of Camus’s philosophy of existentialism. Camus believed that the world was inherently meaningless and that individuals had to find their meaning in this meaningless existence. Meursault is the embodiment of Camus’s philosophy, and his revelation is an acceptance of this philosophy. Therefore, Meursault’s transformation is not just a result of his fear over his impending death but is an acceptance of his place in the world.

In conclusion, Meursault’s transformation in Camus’s The Stranger is authentic and is not just a reaction to his fear of dying. Meursault’s transformation is rooted in his desire for authenticity and honesty and is evident in the way he perceives the world around him. Additionally, Meursault’s acceptance of his impending execution confirms the authenticity of his transformation. Furthermore, Meursault’s transformation is an essential part of Camus’s philosophy of existentialism and is, therefore, an acceptance of his place in the world.
