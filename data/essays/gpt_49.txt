In his song ‘i’, Kendrick Lamar explores his experience of growing up in Compton, one of the most violent and gang-afflicted neighborhoods in Los Angeles. The song reveals the inner turmoil that Lamar struggled with as he wrestled with his identity as a member of the community and as an individual seeking to transcend the violence and negativity around him. Through the lyrics of ‘i’, Lamar employs symbols and patterns to portray his experience of growing up in Compton, as well as his determination to rise above it.

One symbol that Lamar uses frequently in the song is the image of a gun. This symbol represents the violence that was a constant presence in his life, both in the gang-affiliated violence that plagued his community and in the police brutality that he witnessed. The repeated refrain “I love myself” can be seen as a response to this symbol, as Lamar seeks to affirm his own worth and identity in the face of the violence around him. He also declares that he has chosen not to carry a weapon himself, suggesting that he has moved beyond the need to rely on violence for protection.

Another key theme in ‘i’ is that of memory, particularly in relation to Lamar’s childhood experiences. He recalls being bullied and beaten up as a child, and the pain and frustration he felt at the time. However, he also acknowledges that these experiences have shaped him in important ways, helping him to develop resilience and determination, and inspiring him to pursue his passion for music as a means of expressing his experiences and emotions.

The pattern of struggle and redemption is also evident in Lamar’s lyrics. He acknowledges the difficulties of growing up in Compton, but also celebrates his ability to transcend this environment through his music. The line “I done been through a whole lot/Trial, tribulation, but I know God/Satan wanna put me in a bow-tie” suggests that Lamar has faced many challenges on his road to success, but he has overcome these obstacles through his faith and his commitment to his art.

Overall, ‘i’ reveals Kendrick Lamar’s complex relationship with his hometown of Compton, as well as his determination to rise above the violence and negativity that has characterized that community. Through his use of symbols, patterns, and memory, Lamar tells the story of his childhood and his path to success, offering hope and inspiration to those who may be facing similar challenges. In the end, ‘i’ is a testament to the power of self-love, creativity, and resilience in the face of adversity.
