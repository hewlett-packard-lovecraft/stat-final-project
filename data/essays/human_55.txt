Fascism is a form of totalitarianism that has some form of religion or goal that it follows deeply,
or at least convinces the people to follow that religion or goal. Fascism tends to lean towards
traditions and following what people in the past have said. In other words, they look at the past
to determine their actions. Fascism does not like to change, they only like to change when that
change benefits their traditions. In fascism, it also tends to direct people to not think about the
individual, but rather the whole collective themselves. By themselves, they are worthless, but if
they work together, they can become very powerful. This meant the middle class was often
targeted in propaganda campaigns as the middle class was easy to manipulate during times of
crisis. Their purpose in life is to work together to achieve a common goal, and if you help them
achieve that goal, you are a hero of the country. Which brings me to the next point, that in
fascism there should be no need to seek a hero, but rather everyone should seek to become
one themselves by serving or dying for their country. Dying for your country is seen as a very
honorable way to die, and you will gain fulfillment if you do. This idea of fulfillment is very
appealing to people, especially if they seek to do something with their lives or are wanting to
repair their life. If the people do not want to make their lives better, then fascism covers that too.
It gives the masses the idea that they are far greater than anyone else, which brings the people
together to fight for the goals of the fascist government. Fascism brainwashes people, gives
them false information and guides them to fight passionately for a cause that the fascist
government wants.
