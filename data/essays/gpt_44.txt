Tennessee Williams’s play, A Streetcar Named Desire, is a brilliant interweaving of symbolism and metaphor which underlines the emotional journey of the central character Blanche DuBois. One of the recurring symbols used is the motif of light, which is employed to highlight the conflicts and contrasts that exist between the characters. By tracing its occurrence through the play, we can observe what this motif adds to the narrative and characterizations.

The motif of light is used to describe the various characters in the play, suggesting their inner qualities and motivations. Blanche is described as having a ‘delicate beauty’, which is linked to lightness and purity. Stanley, on the other hand, is portrayed as rough, physical, and animalistic, contrasting with Blanche's elegance. This contrast is highlighted by the portrayal of light, with Blanche preferring subdued, indirect lighting while Stanley prefers bright, direct light.

Furthermore, the motif of light is also used to illustrate the inner psychological states of the characters. Blanche has a deep-seated fear of darkness, which she associates with death and the loss of her sanity. She clings to the light, hoping that this will keep her mind ‘undarkened’. On the other hand, Stanley is threatened by the darkness as it represents the potential of losing control, hence, he prefers bright, artificial light to keep his space clearly defined and under his authority.

The visual of the incoming searchlight foreshadows Blanche’s downfall. The scene where this occurs, Blanche is finally exposed, and the result of being bombarded by harsh light is in the form of mental breakdown. The searchlight illuminates her, both physically and psychologically while revealing her past to the police. 

To conclude, the motif of light is an essential device that enables the audience to gain insight into the characters' personalities and fates. The conflict between Blanche and Stanley is highlighted by their opposite tastes in light, and their different reactions to it represent their struggles for power and control. As a result, it adds a layer of meaning to the narrative. Its occurrence through the play gives readers a glimpse into the inner lives of the characters, serving as a powerful visual cue, and amplifying the themes of death, desire, and illusions that drive the plot of the play.
