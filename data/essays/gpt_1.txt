Yossarian is the central character of Joseph Heller’s novel Catch-22. He is portrayed as a soldier who is unwilling to fight, and as a result, he tries to work his way out of the army through various means. Yossarian is depicted as a courageous man who is ultimately flawed by his inability to trust anyone, including himself. Through differing events throughout the novel and his interactions with the other characters, Yossarian grows and evolves.

At the beginning of the book, Yossarian is simply trying to survive World War II. He is intelligent and understands that the epic war is not his fight. His refusal to fly additional missions is motivated by his eventual withdrawal from the war, and it leads him to become more suspicious of his comrades. He is condemned for being disruptive to others, and this leads to fractures in his relationships. He is willing to do whatever it takes to escape the military, but as his mission count grows, he begins to see the futility of it all.

As the novel progresses, Yossarian gradually realizes the true horror and pointlessness of war. Yossarian becomes more disillusioned with the people around him, and the shadow of death hangs heavily over him. He begins to question everything around him; the army, the people, and the ability of people to do good. This inner turmoil leads to moments of madness and hatred, but ultimately also moments of surprising heroism.

Yossarian's relationships with other characters are complicated. He is constantly at odds with his commanding officers and tends to see through their façade of honor and duty. He is distrustful of his peers, whom he suspects are faking their enthusiasm for battle, and he sees himself as a victim of their scheming. His relationships with women, particularly with Nurse Duckett and with the woman in Rome, embody his complicated nature.

In the end, Yossarian finds a way to escape the military, but the price he pays is his own sense of honor and dignity. His experiences throughout the book have left him jaded, cynical, and distrustful of human nature. Yossarian is a uniquely human character who is deeply flawed, yet still a hero in his own way. The lessons we learn from his experiences are a testament to the complexity and difficulty of human existence and the struggle to find hope and meaning in a world that is often cruel and confusing.
