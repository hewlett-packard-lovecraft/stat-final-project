David's decision to step down from his teaching position is based on a flawed assumption that Melanie reciprocates his feelings. His irrational behavior was clouded by infatuation, leading him to believe that Melanie felt the same way. However, Melanie's decision to file a complaint against David brings him back to reality, realizing the gravity of his actions. The prospect of facing charges and being labeled as a sexual predator is too much for David to bear, leading him to abandon his profession altogether.

David's disillusionment is evident in his thoughts as he contemplates the repercussions of his actions. He understands that the intimacy they once shared is now gone, replaced by animosity and legal wrangling. The notion that Melanie, who was once his lover, is now his accuser is a clear indication of the serious nature of the charges against him. 

David's decision to step down from his teaching position may be viewed as a wise one, given the seriousness of the charges against him. His focus now should be on clearing his name and proving his innocence. His actions, though misguided, should not prevent him from fulfilling his professional responsibilities in the future. As an essay writer, I would suggest that David seeks counseling to address any underlying issues that may have contributed to this unfortunate situation. Additionally, he should take active steps to rebuild his reputation and restore his professional standing.
