In Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Act 3 Scene 2 marks a turning point in the play. It is during this scene that two speeches, one by Brutus and the other by Antony, are delivered to the Roman crowd mourning the death of Caesar. In these speeches, the two characters set out to persuade the crowd to their respective views. The purpose of this essay is to compare and contrast the two speeches, to determine how each character aimed to sway the crowd, and to analyze the impact their speeches had on future events.

Brutus delivers his speech first. His intention is to show the crowd that he did not kill Caesar out of jealousy or ambition but for the good of the people. Brutus’ strategy involves appealing to the audience’s rationality by explaining how Caesar was a tyrant. He speaks calmly, using simple language so that the ordinary people of Rome can understand him. Brutus’ speech is based on reason and logic and is designed to appeal to the audience’s sense of duty and patriotism. He achieves this by continuously using the word “honourable” to describe his actions, and clearly stating that he had no personal motive to kill Caesar.

Antony's strategy is different. He aims to turn the audience against Brutus and the other conspirators, and to avenge Caesar. He plays on the emotions of the crowd by using irony and sarcasm to undermine Brutus’ credibility. Anthony's speech is more inflammatory than Brutus’, making direct accusations of murder and branding Brutus a deceiver. By using repetitive rhetorical questions ("But Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honourable man;"), he creates an atmosphere that leads the audience to conclude that Brutus is not, in fact, honourable.

Antony's speech is successful in swaying the crowd to his side, and he is able to incite a riot that turns on Brutus and the conspirators. He has managed to turn public opinion towards Caesar and, by extension, towards himself. Antony’s speech exposes the weaknesses in Brutus’ argument and succeeds in showing him as someone who lacks credibility. The crowd is roused into action, and the conspirators are forced to flee Rome.

The impact of the speeches on future events is significant. Brutus’ speech is designed to suggest that he acted in the best interests of Rome, but it is also designed to set out his agenda for the future. Antony, on the other hand, seeks revenge and wants to restore the old order that Caesar put in place. By winning the hearts and minds of the people, Antony is able to consolidate his power and become the dominant force in Roman politics. He is able to take revenge on those who opposed him and continue with Caesar's legacy. Brutus, meanwhile, is forced to flee Rome and eventually takes his own life. 

To conclude, both Brutus and Antony have different aims and strategies in their speeches in Julius Caesar. Brutus' speech aimed to rationalize his action and provide a logical basis for the audience to accept his motives. Antony's speech, however, delivered an emotional and inflammatory argument to sway the crowd. By depicting Brutus as a deceiver, and painting Caesar as a victim, Antony's speech was ultimately the most successful in terms of weakening the conspirators' grip on power, and consolidating his own position. The consequences of these speeches are far-reaching, and set the tone for the remainder of the play.
