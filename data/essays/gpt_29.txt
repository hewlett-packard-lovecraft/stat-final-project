Nature is a powerful force that can challenge and conquer even the most resilient of individuals. In both the novel, Into the Wild, by John Krauker, and the short story, “To Build a Fire,” by Jack London, nature serves as an unstoppable antagonist that crushes the protagonists' plans and ambitions. While both stories deal with characters who are determined to conquer nature, there are some significant differences in the way they approach this challenge, and how they ultimately succumb to it.

The main character in Into the Wild is Christopher McCandless, who is fascinated by the idea of testing himself against the wilderness of Alaska. In contrast, the protagonist in “To Build a Fire” is an unnamed man motivated solely by greed. While McCandless seeks enlightenment and fulfillment, the man in “To Build a Fire” is driven solely by his desire to get rich. The nature that confronts these men is depicted as being indifferent to their intentions and motivations. It is a force that is beyond their control and can be deadly.

The indomitable violence and strength of nature is palpable in both stories, as both protagonists are defeated by it. Despite his extensive preparation, McCandless is unable to survive the harsh Alaskan wilderness, and ultimately dies from starvation. The man in “To Build a Fire” fails to heed the warnings of the experienced men he encounters on his journey and is eventually killed as his hands become too numb to build a fire to save his life. 

The lessons to be learned from these defeats are both powerful and poignant. Firstly, neither protagonist had enough respect for the power of nature when they set out. They both made critical mistakes and paid for them with their lives. Secondly, both stories warn against the dangers of arrogance and pride, as well as highlighting the importance of humility and respect for one's surroundings. Finally, both works emphasize the insignificance of human life in the grand scheme of nature. 

Nature is indeed an antagonist in the stories, however, it is not malevolent or vengeful, but rather uncaring and indifferent. The stories portray nature as a force beyond human comprehension, and we as humans are simply insignificant beings in this world. Although nature in these stories is cruel, it is the cruelness of a machine, not a human being. 

In conclusion, both Into the Wild by John Krauker and “To Build a Fire” by Jack London portray the power and force of nature in a way that reminds the readers of the insignificance of our existence. Through the protagonist's tragic defeats, the stories caution against arrogance, pride, and lack of respect for nature's power. Ultimately, these works of literature serve as a warning to all those who seek to challenge the natural world.
