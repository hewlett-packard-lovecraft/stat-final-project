Nature is a formidable force that is both beautiful and unforgiving. John Krauker’s novel Into the Wild and Jack London’s short story “To Build a Fire” portray the indomitable violence and strength of nature. These two works of literature depict the power of nature and how it conquers the main characters. This essay will compare and contrast both stories, analyze how nature defeats both protagonists, and the lessons that can be learned from their tragic endings.

The main characters in these two stories are Chris McCandless in Into the Wild and the unnamed protagonist in “To Build a Fire.” Both McCandless and the protagonist are self-reliant, determined, and adventurous. They both enter the wilderness at the start of their respective journeys with a desire to conquer nature and challenge themselves.

However, nature proves to be too powerful for both characters, and they meet their untimely deaths. McCandless dies in the Alaskan wilderness after a series of unfortunate events, while the protagonist in “To Build a Fire” dies from hypothermia when he fails to build a fire to keep himself warm. In both cases, nature serves as the antagonist in these stories, showcasing its dominance over human beings.

The lessons to be learned from these stories are the importance of respecting nature and the consequences of underestimating its power. The characters' lack of preparation, knowledge, and respect for nature leads to their demise. Nature is not to be taken lightly, and it demands our utmost attention, respect, and preparation. Failure to do so can lead to devastating consequences, such as losing one's life.

In conclusion, the stories of Into the Wild and “To Build a Fire” convey the power of nature and the consequences of underestimating its strength. The main characters' defeats and tragic endings serve as a cautionary tale not to take nature for granted and the importance of having respect for it. While nature can be beautiful and awe-inspiring, it also has the power to conquer even the strongest and most self-reliant individuals. It is necessary to prepare and respect nature if we desire to explore and survive within it.
