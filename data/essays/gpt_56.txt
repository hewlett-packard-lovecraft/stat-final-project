In Ray Bradbury's "The Pedestrian," the light from Mr. Mead's house is a symbol of individuality and rebellion against a conformist society. Mr. Mead is the only person walking on the streets at night, but his light is still on. The light symbolizes his rejection of the societal norms and his desire for knowledge and exploration. While the rest of the world is blindly following the norms of the society, Mr. Mead's light is a beacon of hope, representing the importance of independent thinking and freedom of expression. However, the authorities perceive Mead's behavior as a threat, and they punish him harshly for not following their rules, thus showing how society tends to suppress individuality.
