A fish would be more efficient at passing on energy to the next trophic level than mammals. This
is because fish are ectothermic so they don’t need to use as much energy. Endotherms, like
mammals, use a lot of energy for maintaining their body temperature. Fish don’t need to use
large amounts of energy for this, making them more energy efficient. This allows fish to pass on
energy to the next trophic level more efficiently than mammals.
