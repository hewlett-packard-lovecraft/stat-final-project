One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, written by Ken Kesey and published in 1962, is a novel that has been both celebrated and criticized for its treatment of race and gender. The book follows the story of Randle McMurphy as he becomes a patient in a mental institution and challenges the authority of the head nurse, Nurse Ratched. Many have criticized the novel for its portrayal of women and people of color as subservient to the white male protagonist. However, it is important to consider the context of the time period in which the novel was written, as well as the societal and political issues that Kesey addresses through his writing.

Firstly, it is important to address the issue of gender in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Nurse Ratched, the head nurse of the mental institution, is portrayed as a cold and calculating figure who is determined to maintain absolute control over her patients. Many critics argue that she represents the idea of a woman in power being dangerous and oppressive. However, it is important to consider the role of feminism during the time period in which the novel was written. Second-wave feminism, which focused on issues such as reproductive rights and workplace discrimination, was gaining popularity in the 1960s. Nurse Ratched can be seen as a representation of the patriarchal society that feminist activists were fighting against.

Secondly, the novel has been criticized for its treatment of people of color. The only significant character of color in the novel is Chief Bromden, a Native American patient who is mostly silent and narrates the story from the margins. Some critics argue that Bromden is portrayed as a stereotype of the “noble savage” and that his characterization reinforces the idea of people of color as being less intelligent and subordinate to white people. However, it is important to acknowledge the historical context of Native American representation in literature. Indigenous people had been forcibly removed from their land, had their culture erased and had been subjected to genocide. The portrayal of Chief Bromden as a marginalized figure who resists assimilation can be seen as a critique of the treatment of Native Americans in American society.

In conclusion, the criticism of Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest for its treatment of race and gender is not without merit. However, it is important to consider the contextual factors in which the novel was written in order to understand the themes and messages that Kesey was trying to convey. The novel can be seen as a critique of the patriarchal and racist society of the 1960s, and it is still relevant today as we continue to grapple with issues of gender and racial inequality.
