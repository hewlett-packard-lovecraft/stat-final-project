Orwell's essay "Shooting an Elephant" reveals not just his personal conflict with shooting an elephant but also his criticism of the British colonial system and its political authority in Burma. The metaphorical vehicle of the elephant offers Orwell an opportunity to present his case against British colonialism. By portraying himself as the protagonist and his audience as witnesses, Orwell demonstrates the consequences of imperialism and the collision between the colonizers and the colonized.

Orwell's first paragraph in "Shooting an Elephant" provides the background of the story. He describes the role of being a British police officer and implies that his job is to maintain law and order in Burma, part of the British Empire. The opening lines, “In Moulmein, in Lower Burma, I was hated by large numbers of people,” reveal the complexity of the situation. Orwell realizes that he is unpopular among the Burmese, and the following paragraphs highlight how the Burmese have already made him feel conflicted.

Furthermore, the metaphorical vehicle of the elephant is a representation of the British Empire in Burma. Orwell writes that the “beast” was "peaceful" until it was disturbed. The elephant's madness represents British imperialism in Burma. Just as the elephant goes mad when it is provoked, so does the British Empire when it wants to show its power. Orwell is compelled to shoot the elephant because he knows the colonized expect him to do so. Moreover, the elephant's death symbolizes the murder of the Burmese and the Burmese nation's loss.

By the end of the essay, the elephant's metaphor evolves from a symbol of British imperialism to a symbol of the trapped Orwell. His hatred for imperialism overflows into self-hatred, and the terrible qualities of the colonizers intertwine with his moral dilemma. It is evident that Orwell is no different from the colonizers but is a participant in this system. Still, he has enough self-awareness to realize he is not an autonomous agent in Burma. He is trapped within the political authority and structures imposed upon him by his countrymen.

Ultimately, Orwell's essay is a critique of British colonialism and imperialism. Orwell's personal dilemma with shooting the elephant represents the conflicts and ethical dilemmas commonly faced by the British Empire officials in Burma. The novel has a powerful imagery that makes readers realize that the actions of the colonizers have dehumanizing effects on both sides of the imperialist exchange. In conclusion, the metaphorical vehicle of the elephant allows Orwell to present his argument against British colonialism and political authority in Burma.
