The novels, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce and the short story “Araby” both portray key moments in the coming-of-age of a young man. The formative events and movements in the lives of the protagonist, Stephen Dedalus in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and the unnamed narrator in “Araby” depict the journey of self-discovery, observation, and disillusionment in their respective lives. Both Stephen Dedalus and the narrator are portrayed as sensitive, imaginative and isolated individuals. Although there are similarities in their growth, both characters have different experiences, which sets them apart.

In A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Joyce depicts the formative period in the life of Stephen Dedalus. Stephen is a young boy who grows up in a Catholic family and society, where religion, nationalism, and family values are highly regarded. Joyce portrays the early stages of Stephen's life through his family, school and church experiences. Stephen is initially very attached to his family and religious principles, but gradually he evolves and grows apart from them. The pivotal moment in Stephen's growth comes when he decides to leave Dublin to pursue his dreams of becoming an artist. Stephen's journey of self-discovery and attempt to reconcile secular art with his Catholic beliefs forms the central theme of the novel.

Similarly, in the short story “Araby,” the narrator, a young boy, matures and gains perspective through his interactions with the world around him. From the beginning of the story, the boy exhibits a deep fascination with the bazaar. The bazaar symbolizes an escape from his mundane everyday life. However, the boy's infatuation with Mangan's sister leads him down a path of disillusionment. Like Stephen, the boy becomes disillusioned with the church and religion and develops a new perspective on morality and masculinity. The narrator realizes that he can never win Mangan's sister and that the bazaar is just a place of commercialism. The boy's realization marks a turning point in his growth and marks his transition to adulthood.

The growth of both characters is similar in that they experience disillusionment with societal norms, tradition, and religion. Both Stephen and the narrator begin the stories in highly religious and traditional societies, and both end up alienating themselves from their surroundings. Both stories depict the loss of innocence and the realization of a harsh world, one that is devoid of beauty and hope, unlike the thoughts of the young protagonist.

However, both stories also have significant differences. Stephen Dedalus’s journey in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is more intellectually driven and is more self-consciously artistic. Stephen's realization of his vocation to become an artist is a symbolic moment in the novel. He realizes that he needs to escape the restrictions of society to create his own art. In contrast, the narrator's realization in “Araby” is emotional-driven, and is not as abstract as Stephen's. The narrator realizes that his desire for Mangan's sister and the bazaar are unrealistic and self-delusional.

In conclusion, both A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and “Araby” depict the growth of young men. Stephen Dedalus and the unnamed narrator share common experiences in their journey of self-discovery, and eventual disillusionment. However, there are also differences in the way their character evolves in their respective stories. Joyce and the author of “Araby” show the growth and eventual disillusionment of the respective protagonists through their thoughts, experiences and emotions. Portraying the human experience of growth, disillusionment and self-discovery in young men setting an overall theme of enlightenment marking the coming of age of such characters.
