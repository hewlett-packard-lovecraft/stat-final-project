The central meaning of Sonmi 451 is about slavery, consumerism and social status. Sonmi 451, is a slave, mass produced to meet the demands of corporations. The central meaning of Sonmi 451 is revealed in the society, which is controlled by corporations.  Aspects such as the soulrings, implants which identify the classes as well as serve as wallets. I believe the story cautions against consumerism. 

Sonmi 451 is significantly different from other dystopian works that I have read, in the fact that it is revealed that 451â€™s experiences were scripted and perfectly planned by the government to demonise Fabricants. The lack of a victory or clear simple success in Sonmi 451 also differs it from other books, where the main character succeeds in his or her struggle.
