In his Ted Talk entitled ‘What Really Matters at the end of life,’ BJ Miller uses his own personal experience to inform his point of view regarding this question. As a triple amputee and as the former Executive Director of the Zen Hospice Project, Miller has witnessed and lived through some of the most difficult experiences that a human can undergo. Through his anecdotes and stories, as well as his philosophical musings, Miller presents a vision of life and death that is both profound and challenging.

One way in which Miller uses his own experience to inform his point of view is through his discussion of pain and suffering. Having undergone severe physical trauma as a result of a tragic accident while he was in college, Miller has a unique understanding of what it means to live with pain and suffering. This experience has given him a deep sense of empathy towards others who are facing similar challenges. As a hospice worker, he has spent countless hours helping patients and their families deal with pain and suffering at the end of life. Through his work and his own lived experience, Miller has come to the conclusion that pain is an inevitable part of life and that there is no escaping it. However, he argues that we can learn to live with pain and even find meaning in it.

Another way in which Miller uses his own experience to inform his point of view is through his discussion of the role of palliative care at the end of life. Palliative care is the medical specialty that focuses on providing relief from the symptoms and stress of serious illness. As someone who has undergone a great deal of medical treatment over the course of his life, Miller has a deep understanding of the ways in which palliative care can make a difference. He argues that palliative care is not just about relieving pain, but about helping patients and their families find meaning and purpose in their lives, even in the face of great suffering.

Finally, Miller uses his own experience to inform his point of view by challenging us to think about what really matters in life. As someone who has faced his own mortality on multiple occasions, Miller has a unique perspective on what is truly important in life. He argues that we need to shift our focus away from material things and towards meaningful relationships and experiences. By doing so, we can live a life that is full and rich, even in the face of adversity.

In conclusion, BJ Miller’s personal experiences as a triple amputee and as a hospice worker inform his point of view on what really matters at the end of life. Through his anecdotes and stories, as well as his philosophical musings, Miller challenges us to rethink our attitudes towards pain and suffering, palliative care, and the meaning of life itself. While his ideas may be difficult to accept, they are nonetheless thought-provoking and worthy of our attention and consideration.
