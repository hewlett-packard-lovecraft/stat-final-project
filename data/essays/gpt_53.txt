Ernest Hemingway's short story, "The Old Man and the Sea," is a tale about an old Cuban fisherman named Santiago and his journey to catch a giant marlin. Despite his efforts, he faces numerous obstacles including the sharks that attack his catch. The old man faces immense physical and emotional challenges throughout the story and his biggest test is when he fights the sharks. In this essay, I will argue that although the old man faces a tough defeat against the sharks, he is not defeated.

In the beginning, Santiago is depicted as a man who is struggling with disappointment and the feeling of being defeated. He has not caught a fish in 84 days and has been continuously mocked by his peers for his poor fishing skills. However, Santiago refuses to give up on his dream and sets out to catch a marlin. After days of waiting, he finally succeeds in catching the giant fish. Despite being attacked by the sharks, Santiago remains relentless in his efforts to bring the catch ashore. This is evident when he battles the sharks with his harpoon and knife. Even though he is unable to save his catch, he refuses to give up and continues fighting until the end.

In the final scene, Santiago is exhausted, bruised, and beaten by the sharks but he still finds the courage to make his way home. He may not have the fish with him but he is contented with the knowledge that he fought until the end and never gave up. This shows that even though he faced defeat in his quest to catch the fish, the old man was not defeated.

In conclusion, the old man in Ernest Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea" is not defeated at the end of the story. Despite losing his prized catch to the sharks, Santiago is still determined to continue living his life. He has proven that he is a man that cannot be defeated no matter how difficult the challenges. Therefore, the essence of the story lies not in whether or not he caught the fish, but rather in the journey he took to get there and the lessons he learned along the way.
