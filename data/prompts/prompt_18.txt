Please write a roughly 400-word five-paragraph essay response to the following question:
In The Corrections by Jonathan Frazen, Are elements of the Lambert family universal characteristics of the American
family? How do the world in general and family life in particular change during
the half century that the novel spans? In what ways is life better now than
when the Lambert children were young? In what ways is it worse?
