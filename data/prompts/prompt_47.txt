This surrounds the
idea of KNOWLEDGE as JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF. In a five-paragraph PERSUASIVE
ESSAY of AT LEAST 400 WORDS, please do the following:
Argue for the establishment of some new form of knowledge which you believe me to be ignorant or unaware of.
This may mean you persuading me that homework is bad, or that music is wasteful art, or that all sports are a waste of time - or something else. This essay can cover LITERALLY ANYTHING - the basis is that you must try and establish a NEW FORM OF KNOWLEDGE by attempting to persuade me of the JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF of your argument
If you need tips, strategies, or even just more explanation on what this topic is asking you to do, feel free to reach out - just realize that it is very open-ended
