In a five-paragraph essay response of at least 350 words, please respond to the following
question: ‘In the novel Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell, How are the first four stories/narratives interlinked and connected? What
is the thematic purpose of that connection, and does it feel essential to the
individual plot-lines, or just gimmicky?’
1. Pay attention to the individual thematic purpose and plot-line of each narrative,
along with how they reference one another
2. What are the thematic links that are tied together here? Is there something that
Mitchell is trying to cast across each of the narratives?
