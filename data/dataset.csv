human_1.txt,"The protagonist Yossarian in Joseph Heller's Catch-22 has a variety of unique character traits not typical of a stereotypical hero. He takes a variety of actions that separate him from the characters around him. Yossarian’s ideals and motivations are unique in that he only cares about his own survival. Yossarian is also an outsider due to his willingness for insubordination, ideals, and unique name, and as a result many in his squadron treat him differently.  However, he undergoes a change towards the end of the novel.	Yossarian’s actions can be considered unheroic. He does not risk his life for America’s cause and sometimes resorts to deception in the name of self preservation. Unlike Havemeyer, who “never takes evasive action” and is thus the most accurate bombardier in the squadron, Yossarian does take evasive action. “[Yossarian] had decided to live forever or die in the attempt, and his only mission each time he went up was to come down alive” (19). He does not care about the mission, only his own life, whereas a conventional heroic figure would be willing to sacrifice himself for everyone else. In order to avoid a dangerous bombing raid to Bologna, he “knocked on wood, crossed his fingers, and tiptoed out of his tent to move the bomb line up over Bologna” (90) in the middle of the night. This shows how he is willing to deceive others and not consider the repercussions of his actions. This one in particular led to the death of Major Decoverly. In the opening scene of the novel, Yossarian is shown to be faking illness in order to be excused from combat: “Yossarian was in the hospital with a pain in his liver…. The pain in his liver had gone away, but Yossarian didn't say anything and the doctors never suspected” (2). Yossarian consciously makes the decision to lie to the doctors and waste everyone’s time even though he was not actually hurt. Although he is a war hero, he does not act as a reader would expect.	Unlike a typical hero, Yossarian wants to stay alive more than anything. His indefatigable sense of self-preservation can somewhat be justified with the nonsensical bureaucracy of the US Military that obliges soldiers into risking their lives for increasingly illogical reasons. For example, each time the pilots come close to fulfilling the combat mission requirement, it is increased by Colonel Cathcart. “Colonel Cathcart was overjoyed, for he was relieved of the embarrassing commitment to bomb Bologna without blemish to the reputation for valor he had earned by volunteering his men to do it” (pg). In order to augment their own reputations, colonels and generals volunteer their men in the most dangerous missions. This quote also reveals the absurdity of the Armed Forces’ decision to recognize and reward colonels who do nothing but volunteer their squadrons to fulfill dangerous missions. Yossarian’s motivations are another thing that separates him from the others in the squadron, who already treat him differently for his Assyrian name and think that he is insane.	However, Yossarian does undergo a change. Although he has a strong sense of self-preservation, he still cares deeply for his crew and is deeply affected by the death of the young Snowden. He is constantly reminded of Snowden: “He was wide-awake, and he knew he was a prisoner in one of those sleepless, bedridden nights that would take an eternity to dissolve into dawn. A throbbing chill oozed up his legs. He was cold, and he thought of Snowden.” (336) In the end of the novel, he takes the deal Cathcart offers him and places the squadron over himself. He is offered “go home a big hero if Isay nice things about them to everybody and never criticize them to anyone for making the rest of the men fly more missions.'” (91) He doesn’t take the deal to be sent home a hero and flees.	Yossarian is an antihero. His ideals and actions can be considered cowardly and unheroic. Yossarian wants to stay alive more than anything. He is willing to deceive others to this end, but towards the end he becomes more willing to value the lives of others when he refuses the deal Cathcart offers him.Specific moments where you think the author uses ""dark humour"" and its importance or purpose.Joseph Heller uses dark humor in the novel Catch-22 in order to deal with serious issues such as the horrors of war, the effects of war on individuals, and religion. He sometimes utilizes a lighthearted tone while describing the horrors of war and the fragility of life. When Snowden is seriously wounded in the climax of the novel, Yossarian reaches into the medical kit to find “a cleanly lettered note that said: 'What's good for M & M Enterprises is good for the country. Milo Minderbinder.'” (336) Yossarian’s seemingly imminent death is contrasted with an incident of war profiteering in a humorous but callous manner: “'Why can't you be a fatalist about it the way I am? If I'm destined to unload these lighters at a profit and pick up some Egyptian cotton cheap from Milo, then that's what I'm going to do. And if you're destined to be killed over Bologna, then you're going to be killed, so you might just as well go out and die like a man.” (93) Even religion is dealt with in a lighthearted manner: “Thank God!” Half-Stoat exclaims. “There is no God!” Yossarian exclaims. Heller utilizes dark humor in order to make certain topics more approachable.",916,4451,0
human_2.txt,"Steven Pinker’s “A History of Violence: Edge Master Class 2011” lecture serves the purpose of arguing that violence has been in a period of decline for millennia, and that we are living in the most peaceful period in human history. Pinker presents his argument, provides six periods in which violence declined in chronological order along with possible causes, and then correlates these declines with the rise of several social movements. He ends his lecture with a question-answer period. He fulfills his purpose well, as his connectives and transitions are smooth and with proper variety and vocabulary is varied and not dry or repetitive.  Pinker makes significant use of anecdote, analogy, and statistics to strengthen his argument.	Steven Pinker begins by outlining his argument, that “violence has been in decline over long stretches of time, and we may be living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence.” He debunks Rousseau's conclusion that ""Nothing could be more gentle than man in his primitive state,"" and argues for Hobb’s argument that ""the life of man is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short."" He delineates six periods in which violence declined in human history: firstly, the “Pacification Proccess,” with the emergence of centralized government; the “Civilizing Proccess,” with the abolition of judicial torture; the “abolition of the death penalty in Europe”, and the “Aboliton of Slavery.” Pinker then correlates this decrease in violence with several social movements, such as abolitionism, the rise of democracies, and feminism, concluding ithat "" He ends his lecture with a question-answer period and “calls for a rehabilitation of a concept of modernity and progress, and for a sense of gratitude for the institutions of civilization and enlightenment that have made it possible.”	He presents his argument well. His connectives and transitions are seamless. He uses vocabulary such as This is evidenced and? To what end?	Pinker makes significant use of devices such as anecdote, analogy, and statistics to strengthen his argument. He strengthens nearly every statement he makes with a statistic, such as one for the sudden drop of homicide in Europe, homicides in England, and genocides in the 20th century, for a total of 42 graphs. He provides statistics from homicide and judicial torture, all the way to child spanking and animal cruelty. Pinker provides a multitude of analogies to assist the reader. In informing the reader of what mindsets promote violence, he says, “There are studies showing that violence is more common when people are confined to one pecking order… if I do something stupid when I'm driving, and someone gives me the finger and calls me an asshole, it's not the end of the world: I think to myself, I’m a tenured professor at Harvard.”	Pinker argues that violence has been in decline _______, and the 20th century was not the most violent century in history. He begins by outlining his argument, that “violence has been in decline over long stretches of time, and [that] we may be living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence,” thereby debunking Rousseau and arguing for Hobbs. Pinker presents his argument well. His connectives and transitions are seamless. Pinker makes significant use of devices such as anecdote, analogy, and statistics to strengthen his argument,. Using a variety of strategies, a strong structure, and flawless transitions, Pinker argues that the 20th century is the most peaceful in human history, concluding with “a sense of gratitude for the institutions of civilization and enlightenment that have made it possible.”",577,3049,0
human_3.txt,"In the play “Death of a Salesman”, the four main characters all have differing motivations. Willy Loman wants to be successful and well liked. His sons, Biff and Happy, both want to be like their father and be successful, but both are considered to be failures by their father. Linda Loman, the mother, is the stable foundation of the family. These four central characters all have different linked motivations, which are the key driving force in their conflict, and in the story. Willy Loman, the delusional father of the family, just wants to become successful by following the American Dream. He believes that his success is tied to his likeability, which he extends to his family. He created a facade of success to his wife and children, with his favorite mantra, “The jungle is dark, but full of diamonds”. He cannot understand that he is a literal failure, which negatively impacts his mental health, causing him to have flashbacks to his past. He is so desperate to succeed with his “Willyness”, that he cannot recognize his slanted view of the world. Ultimately, he accepts his failure, and commits suicide, and thereby helping one of his sons start the American Dream with his inheritance. Biff Loman is the 34 year old son of Willy Loman. He is seen by his father as a failure and an underachiever. However, Biff’s underachievement only occurred due to his father, when he discovered Willy with a mistress when he was in school, thus breaking his belief in his father and causing him to lose faith in school and in Willy’s ambitions for him. Unlike his younger sibling Happy, Biff is unwilling to believe his father's facade of success. He wishes to leave to the wild west, to work with his own hands to achieve his own success, as revealed in his conversation with Happy: “Sure, maybe we could buy a ranch. Raise cattle, use our muscles. Men built like we are should be working out in the open.” Biff just wants to leave and strike it out on his own.Happy Loman is the 32 year old younger brother to Biff. Unlike his brother, he is fully willing to accept his father's facade. He ends up fully believing in his father, which causes him to lack any ability to escape from Willy’s vision. Happy embodies the worst parts of Willy, happily and completely believing in the American Dream while sharing Willy’s skill in deceiving himself. Unfortunately, Happy is completely doomed to Willy’s failures, as demonstrated when he makes a vow to go to New York to follow in his father’s footsteps. Linda Loman, the mother in the family, shares aspects from every member of the family. She shares some of the self delusion from Happy and Willy, but she is also able to break away from her husband's delusions of success.She just wants the family to be successful, by carrying out the traditional gender roles. At the start of the play, as Willy appears distressed, she takes off his coat and shoes for him, thereby easing his burden. In conclusion, Death of a Salesman’s four central characters all feature linked motivations. Willy is the center of the link, causing Biff to want to go out on his own, while Happy wants to follow in his father's failed footsteps. Linda tries to be supportive among the mess, but Willy’s facade of success disallows him from accepting her support. Ultimately, Willy’s suicide lifts the family from many burdens. ",581,2765,0
human_4.txt,"In the novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce, main character Stephen rebels against his Irish identity. He rebels against the influence of Catholic religion, irish identity, and questions what it means to be Irish. Joyce’s novel follows the development of Stephen Dadalus’s identity by highlighting his development as an artist and his experiences growing up in a devoutly religious Catholic family.  First, Stephen questions his Irish identity and nationality. Specifically, the role that the Catholic church has in politics when it conflicts with the interest of the Irish people. Stephan hears: “Nobody is saying a word against them, said Mr Dedalus, so long as they don’t meddle in politics.—The bishops and priests of Ireland have spoken, said Dante, and they must be obeyed.—Let them leave politics alone, said Mr Casey, or the people may leave their church alone.” (20) Stephen watches in bewilderment as the adults around him argue about core parts of Irish identity. The conflict between Irish patriotism and the Catholic Church, both core aspects of being Irish, confuses Stephen, causing him to question his core identity as an Irish person. Secondly, Stephen questions his catholic religion,causing him to flip flop between a religious fanatic, and constantly going against his religion. Joyce writes: “He wanted to sin with another of his kind, to force another being to sin with him and to exult with her in sin.” (67) On the other hand, Stephen becomes a devout cathiolic after hearing a sermon by Father Arnall. “He flung the blankets from him madly to free his face and neck. That was his hell. God had allowed him to see the hell reserved for his sins: stinking, bestial, malignant, a hell of lecherous goatish fiends. For him! For him!” (91) Arnell’s sermon fills him with guilt, turning him into a model catholic. Stephen flip flops between sin and devotion, causing him to question his religion, eventually causing him to find a middle ground between the two. In conclusion, Stephen’s upbringing in Ireland with the strict rules of the Catholic Church causes him to question his identity, eventually creating and shaping his own unique ideas as an artist.    Other than the Parnell Christmas dinner incident, identify one major incident that affects Stephen emotionally in Chapter 1. How does it change him? Why?Stephen is pushed into a cesspool and is sent to the infirmary. He comes to terms with his last name, after another person in the infirmary sympathises with him. ",420,2099,0
human_5.txt,"Fashion is a puzzling topic. Fashion appeals to certain teens for a multitude of reasons. The most common is a sense of exclusivity. People like to feel unique, and the purchase of an expensive limited-run jacket allows them to feel that. Others view their appearance as an extension of themselves and will attempt to use clothing to reflect that. Finally, peer pressure is an important part of why fashion is an important part of certain teen’s identities. Teenagers like to mimic their peers, allowing them to feel like they fit in to a certain group.A sense of exclusivity is the main reason why some teenagers purchase clothing. The possestion of limited-run shirts, jackets, and hoodies allows one to feel special despite deficiencies in other areas. By dressing similar to their peers, a teenager may be able to feel more of a sense of belonging. By mirroring others, an adolescent can mirror their close friends. A good-looking piece of clothing may also allow one to feel more confident. Adoseclents preoccupied with their appearance also see their clothing as a reflection of their identities. One may dress a certain way to give off a certain impression. A teenager going to a job interview will dress differently than a teenager going to school. Someone may choose a certain article of clothing in order to express a certain emotion. A brand’s clothing can be purchased in order to link the brand’s image of affluence with the wearer.The effects of this inane preoccupation on one’s personal appearance can be felt in environmental damage and in the economies of developing countries across the world. The extremely lucrative industry of “fast fashion” encourages consumerism and motivates consumers to constantly purchase new clothing to keep up with the latest trends, resulting in enormous waste as the clothing no longer socially relevant is eventually thrown away, causing water pollution. Cheap materials like Nylon requires enormous amounts of water and is hard to break down. The low margins of fast fashion encourages companies to push down wages and cut corners.An individual can express their identity, affluence, and self-esteem through their clothing. Thus, it is understandable why the fast fashion industry has continued to exist and expand despite it’s severe impacts on both the environment and the economy.",377,1959,0
human_6.txt,"Pi’s journaling is a commentary on the need for communication. Without human interaction, humans will eventually lose the will to live. His journal gives him a chance to communicate his emotion, and keep a clear mind. The journal is not a full substitute for human communication. He loses the will to live even with the journal, which is only solved by the short meeting with the frenchman. The diary is important to him, and a combination of starvation and running out of ink - which means no more journaling -  causes him to lose the will to live.	Pi’s diary describes his daily activities, and served many other functions. Journaling was not only a “restful activity” for him, it also allowed him to forget”even the very notion of time.” 	Pi’s diary not only chronicles his daily activities, it also provides a way for him to communicate his emotions. It allowed for him to keep a clear mind, as evidenced by the fact that he sunk into a deep depression after running out of ink. The last entry in his journal is “Today I die. I will die today. I die.” Without the diary to keep his mind clear, he becomes depressed. This depression, one could argue, leads him to hallucinatory behaviour. He hallucinates interactions, both with the Frenchman, and with Richard Parker. This demonstrates that, at a base level, the thing that all humans need is companionship and interaction.  The diary, though it may help him pass the time, is not a full substitute for human interaction.	Pi’s depression is cured suddenly by the meeting with the frenchman. After a short conversation, the first conversation he had in months, he becomes motivated to continue to survive. Although Pi is disgusted by the Frenchman, and the result of the altercation is the violent death of the Frenchman, Pi is roused by the incident. Rather than resign to his fate, he scavenges the Frenchman’s lifeboat for food, and catches a fish.	Pi’s journal says something about the human need for communication. It proves that without communication, humans will go insane. A combination of a lack of paper for his journal and starvation caused Pi to believe that he will die. However, after meeting the Frenchman, he snaps out of it and survives. Without the journal or Richard Parker, Pi “would die of hopelessness.”",390,1889,0
human_7.txt,"Suicide has become an increasing problem in the past two decades. Suicide rates have climbed dramatically since the early 2000s, a study by the CDC shows. Although teenage suicides make up a relatively tiny proportion of suicides, it is still important to find out the factors involved. Suicide victims often have a mental illness, a family history of suicide, have a history of substance abuse, or have shown impulsive or aggressive behaviour. The common causes of suicide include depression or trauma after a traumatic event, cyber or in-person bullying, or social rejection and isolation.The background of suicide victims often share similar characteristics. They may suffer from a mental illness, such as anxiety, social anxiety, or depression. Other psychiatric illnesses such as mood disorders, eating disorders, or schizophrenia may also put one at greater risk. The effect of alcohol or other drugs also cannot be ignored; up to one in three suicide victims have had a history of substance abuse. Impulsive or aggressive teens may also be put at a higher risk due to the fact that they may lash out in an unsafe manner towards themselves or others if not given a safe outlet. Finally, many adolescent teens whoCommon causes are multifaceted and varied. A common cause is the aforementioned mental or physiatric illnesses. A schizophrenic person may have audiovisual hallucinations that drive them towards suicide even though they themselves may not seek it. Dysphoria, mood disorders, or eating disorders may cause an adolescent to have low self-esteem. Clinical depression is another factor. Cyberbullying and regular bullying may result in suicidal thoughts. Teens who have been cyberbullied are up to three times more likely to attempt suicide, a study by the NIH reveals.Methods of addressing these factors exist. Better access to therapy and mental health professionals may mitigate the risk factor of teens with mental or physiatric illness. “Suicide is a common risk factor that pertains to nearly all CODs and particularly those involving addiction and MDD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, PTSD, or PDs,” the study “Substance Use Disorder Treatment for People With Co-Occurring Disorders, (Yuodelis-Flores & Ries, 2015)“ says.  Awareness surrounding the effects of controlled substances may mitigate the risk of many such disorders. Factors leading up to cyberbullying should also be researched and resolved.In conclusion, the factors and causes involved in suicide are wide, multifaced, and complicated and the topic of suicide cannot be adequately given attention to an essay of 300 words. Victims often suffer from a variety of problems. Factors can range from dysphoria to depression to social isolation to cyberbullying.",425,2318,0
human_8.txt,"David Sedaris utilizes various techniques in order to present himself as a unique person and writer in his humorous collection of essays Me Talk Pretty One Day. Sedaris shows that he values individuality through the various interactions with teachers and the education system he places focus on. His writing is teeming with deeply sardonic comments, revealing his deadpan sense of humour. Finally, Sedaris chooses to focus on events such as his brief period with Mrs. Samson and his efforts to learn French, revealing his early fascination with language. Sedaris presents himself as an individual who has had a strong sense of individuality from a young age. An example of Sedaris’s contempt towards authority is his first essay, “Me Talk Pretty One Day.” When asked to see the speech therapist, his first inclination is that he has done something wrong, quickly thinking of “a list of recent crimes, looking for a conviction that might stick” (1). Sedaris communicates that he has never been able to fit in. “We knocked ourselves out trying to fit in but were ultimately betrayed by our tongues” (4), he says. Not only is he separated from his peers by virtue of his sexuality and his lisp, he also seperates himself from others through his own inflated ego. “It occurred to me that, with the exception of the guitar, [Mr. Mancini] and I actually had quite a bit in common. We were each a man trapped inside a boy's body” (10). He sees himself as an adult, rather than a child. It is evident from his work that Sedaris has a strong sense of individuality.(2nd paragraph)David Sedaris’s fascination with language is evident from the very beginning, with his essay “Me Talk Pretty One Day.” After struggling through speech therapy as a child, he accidently discovers the creativity that can be had in language: “tried to avoid an s sound whenever possible. ""Yes,"" became ""correct,"" or a military ""affirmative."" ""Please,"" became ""with your kind permission,"" and questions were pleaded rather than asked.” This event foreshadows his efforts to pursue fluency in French later in life.It is evident that Sedaris is a unique person and writer. He values individuality ",361,1802,0
human_9.txt,"Miller uses his own experiences to inform his views in his TED talk “What really matters at the end of life?”. Using his own experiences as a patient and a doctor, Miller informs the audience that a patient’s priorities change when they are near death. When they are near their expiration date, patients tend to become irrational, as proven by Miller’s anecdotes. He uses anecdotes from a palliative care facility he runs in order to contrast its superiority in the welfare of the soon to be deceased. He then uses his own experience with the American healthcare system in order to highlight it’s deficiencies and the attitudes of a patient. Miller uses his own experiences as a patient to influence his views. He references his experience as a burn patient wearing a nurse smuggled a snowball for him. After a poor life decision at a Sophomore Thanksgiving party, Miller becomes a long term burn patient in the American healthcare system. He describes an instance where a nurse gave him a snowball on a snowy day. As a bedridden patient who could not leave his windowless room, this type of friendliness was incredibly meaningful. This anecdote serves as an example of what the American healthcare system lacks, what usually becomes “a stolen moment,” and is a core part of what informs Miller’s views on palliative care.The speaker’s own experiences are the reason for his knowledge of the needs of dying patients. While “everyone who goes into healthcare really means well,” the healthcare system ultimately “does not serve.” Hospitals “are places for acute trauma and treatable illness.” “They are no place to live and die; that’s not what they were designed for.” Without his experience as a long term burn patient, he would not have these views on palliative care.Finally, Miller uses his experience with his patients to inform his views on the shifted perspectives of those nearing their best-before date. He gives examples, like the woman who started smoking “to feel her lungs filled while she [still] has them”. He speaks of Frank, a prostate cancer patient at Zen Hospice, who goes to “raft down the Colorado River” rather than “more chemotherapy coursing through his veins.” These experiences assist in forming his view that the dying and soon to be mortally challenged will prioritize “comfort; feeling unburdened and unburdening to those they love; existential peace; and a sense of wonderment and spirituality” over their own survival.Miller’s perspective on death is affected by a poor life decision and the resulting experience in the healthcare system, and his over thirty years of work in the Zen Hospice Project, a palliative care facility.",439,2222,0
human_10.txt,"Garret Hardin in his article “Lifeboat Ethics: the Case Against Helping the Poor” presents his argument well but does not take into account demographic transition into account while talking  against immigration. Due to the limited “carrying capacity of our land” and environmental degradation, the United States must reject immigrants or the environment will collapse due to the increased load. His depiction of the world outside America and Europe is condescending at best, and his ideas are dangerous in that Harden and others are able to and have used them to support nationalist, isolationism, and racial discrimination. Hardin presents his case well, but his argument is severely flawed.Hardin’s arguments against immigration are based on the false idea that population growth is infinite and grows at a constant rate: “Outside our lifeboat, let us imagine another 210 million people …  who are increasing at a rate of 3.3 percent per year. Put differently, the doubling time for this aggregate population is 21 years.” He does not take into account the Demographic Transition Model, a concept in sociology taught in tenth grade Social Studies. According to the Demographic Transition Model, a nation’s total population growth rate cycles through five stages. In the first stage, birth rates are high and the overwhelming majority of the population is young. As a nation develops and industrializes, fertility rates fall significantly below their replacement rates. Death rates become higher than birth rates. The population grows older and the population declines. Social programs such as pensions may collapse as the workforce retires. 	In order to maintain a workforce of working age that is able to pay taxes, stimulate the economy, and fund social programs such as socialized healthcare and the Candian Pension Plan, many nations, such as Canada, and most of Europe have resorted to accepting immigrants. However, this is still is not a sustainable strategy. As third world countries continue to develop, their workforces will shrink too. Governments that subscribe to Hardin’s ideology will find themselves with a very dire situation: a shrinking population, a shrinking workforce, and a shrinking economy. Albeit for different reasons, Japan is in a similar conundrum. Over 40% of their population is over the age of 65 and this is expected to increase to 60% by 2050.	Hardin’s ideas are not only flawed, they can also be used to justify racial discrimination. His lifeboat analogy is condescending. He portrays the United States as one of the few beacons of safety in the inhospitable ocean that is the rest of the world, and that the rest of the world will stay that way. “ In the ocean outside each lifeboat swim the poor of the world, who would like to get in, or at least to share some of the wealth,” he declares. Hardin’s metaphor is dangerous, it can be and has been used to support racial discrimination and anti-immigrant sentiment. Garret Hardin himself was a nationalist and eugenist, and has been recognized by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a white nationalist. If the United States is a beacon of safety in an inhospitable ocean, why not take pride in your “small safety factor” and it’s ethnicity? If the preservation of the world’s finite resources is of paramount importance, why not restrict women’s reproductive rights?	Garret Harden’s metaphor is fatally flawed despite its solid presentation. His predictions of immigrants exhausting the food supply is unlikely to come to pass. Immigration has even been used by many nations to extend the workforce of their aging populations. Hardin’s lifeboat analogy is dangerous, for it has been used by Hardin and others to use environmental sustainibility to justify racial discrimination and the restriction of women’s repoructive rights. In the past decades, improvements in renewable energy have somewhat mitigated the threat of finite energy. Harden’s ideas should be rejected. Let us all cooperate and commit to  ",642,3355,0
human_11.txt,"In Joseph Heller’s novel Catch-22, Snowden’s death is a motif that provides readers with insight on Yossarian’s motivations, character, and moral development. Yossarian relives Snowden’s last moments multiple times throughout the novel, giving insight to his morals and mindset. Snowden’s death is revealed to be the cause of Yossarian’s moral development into a cynical captain who mostly cares about his own self-preservation.	The circumstances of Snowden’s death are eventually revealed detail by detail as he recalls the event at random times. “'Where are the Snowdens of yesteryear?'” (23) he asks in an educational session. When Yossarian is in the hospital for a stab wound in Chapter 41, all the details of the event are revealed. Hungry Joe has died, reminding Yossarian of Snowden, a gunner and a, “vaguely familiar kid who was badly wounded and freezing to death in the puddle of harsh yellow sunlight splashing into his face through the side gunport” (338). Yossarian attempts to treat Snowden’s wounds until, “Snowden's insides slithered down to the floor in a soggy pile” (338). This event results in his awareness of his own mortality, that. “Man was matter … Drop himout a window and he'll fall. Set fire to him and he'll burn. Bury him and he'll rot, like other kinds of garbage” (338). The traumatic experience of Snowden’s death is the cause of Yossarian’s views towards mortality.	Snowden’s death made death seem all the more visceral to Yossarian, and he became determined to preserve his own life at all costs. The death of Snowden eventually culminates in the main moral conflict of the novel. Although Yossarian is horrified at the thought of his own death, he is almost equally concerned for the fate of his squadron members. Yossarion is offered an “odious” deal: Yossarian is “sen[t]  home  a  hero” (328) with the condition that he must “say nice things about [Cathcart and Korn] here and back in the States.” Then, the men of the squadron would be “easy enough to discipline and control” and no one would question Cathcart and Korn’s treatment of the squadron members. Yossarian has to choose between his own well-being at the expense of the troops and the fate of the soldiers.	The death of Snowden provides the reader with insight into the mindset of Yossarian, his moral development, and finally sets up the main moral conflict Yossarian is presented with.

human_12.txt,"In Albert Camus’s The Stranger, the main character of Meursalt suffers a revelation before his execution. Meursalt’s revelation while awaiting execution is a genuine revelation, and he is not simply feeling fear over his impending death. He is at a breaking point when he snaps at the priest, and he is finally no longer socially isolated to what is happening around him. He begins to see his life as having a past, present, and future, rather than focusing on just the physical present, and then makes peace with his death.Meursault accepts his inevitable death and begins to look forward to it. He undergoes a kind of existentialist revelation, and “lays [his] heart open to the benign indifference of the universe.” He finds a purpose in order to find fulfillment and hope, and to be hated by society. He wishes that “on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration.” Meursault ponders his situation and encounters a kind of revelation, wherein he finds that there could possibly be extrinsic meaning to his life, in place of the intrinsic meaning he’d been lacking. Meursault’s turning point is his time in the prison cell, culminating in the discussion with the priest. For the first time, he is no longer isolated from the world around him. He is finally reactive rather than passive, a new development. A new emotion is exposed to him: irritation and revulsion. The idea of a pardon or an afterlife would run against his acceptance of the inevitable death. In the prison, he gains the new ability to analyse not only the material present but his past and future as well, contrasting with the extreme lack of self-awareness in the previous parts of the story. He sees no difference between dying then or twenty years in the future, and becomes content and satisfied with his fate. This revelation speaks to the idea of existentialism that says ‘if there is no existence, then essence doesn’t matter’	Meursault is not feeling fear over his pending death, and he has been given the opportunity to ponder upon his life and societal situation. In fact, Meursault is seemingly unable to feel the fear of death, and even views it as the only certain thing in life.

human_13.txt,"The cultivation, consumption, cultural usage, and trade of spirits and coffee has had significant impacts on society that were both positive and negative. Spirits served as medicine, then a global tool for bartering. Regulation on rum was an important step in the road to the American war of independence, and the whisky rebellion was a key moment in the history of the United States. The development of Coffee led to the spread of coffee houses, key locations of scientific discourse during the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment. Overall, the development of spirits and coffee was a positive rather than negative invention.	Spirits were used as anything from medicine to currency. Distillation was first used as medicine. Heavily distilled wine was known as Aqua Vitae, and was initially thought to be a miracle cure, a “beverage destined to revive the energies of modern decrepitude.” (73) It was thought to cure everything from toothache, blindness, speech defect, paralysis, to the plague. However, it eventually shifted from medicinenal to recreational use. When Rum was refined from the by-products of the sugar making process, it became used as payment for slaves, medicine for scurvy, and something to barter with. Rum had an unfortunate use of a form of social control over slaves, who harvested the sugar cane the Rum was refined out of. Rum, due to it’s high alcohol content, was excellent for bartering with far-off indigenous peoples in South and Central America. As a result, it became a tool of imperialism and exploitation.	Before the American war of independence, the regulation of rum was a source of ire for the American colonists. As British producers of rum lost out to New England distillers, they demanded government intervention. Soon, the 1733 Molasses Act was passed. It levied a prohibitive six pence per gallon on molasses imported into what would be the United States, the source of rum. This levy added to the growing discontent of the colonists that eventually came to a boil with the American war of independence. The Whiskey rebellion of 1794 was a key moment in early America - the use of Federal militias to put down the rebelling brewers was one of the first demonstrations of Federal power.The development of Coffee led to the spread of coffee houses, key locations of scientific discourse during the Scientific Revolution. The first coffee houses opened in Oxford by a Lebanese man by the name of Jacob. They quickly became a location of scientific discourse between intellectuals, and they spread across Europe with the Scientific Revolution. The work Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica (Mathematical principles of natural philosophy), a great work on the theory of gravity by Issac Newton, was written in a coffeehouse. It is clear that coffee, as a neural stimulant, played a key role in the growth of science and philosophy	The cultivation, consumption, cultural usage, and trade of spirits and coffee has had significant impacts on society that were both positive and negative, but their developments were mostly positive overall. Although spirits were a tool of imperialism as they were used to barter for slaves and with indegenous peoples who had not yet been exposed to alcohol, spirits were a factor in the American war of independence and coffeehouses were a key location for intellectual discussion during the Scientific Revolution.

human_14.txt,"The cultivation, consumption, and trade of beer and wine have had a profound influence on the development of human society, as emphasized in “A History of the World in 6 Glasses” by Tom Sandage. Beer allowed for the development of pottery, allowed Mesopotanians to develop bread, and allowed Mesopotamian society to fight off famine. The development of beer allowed it to be used as both a nutritious food, a clean source of water, and a form of currency in Egypt, in addition to being of great cultural and religious significance. In Greece and Rome, wine was a universal staple consumed by all social classes, and was a prominent tool for religious ceremonies. Alcohol has been used for a variety of purposes throughout history.	Beer, one of the earliest forms of alcohol, was used extensively in 4000 BCE Mesopotamia for a variety of purposes. Beer was thought to be a driving factor in the development of watertight containers and pottery, which were instrumental in the creation of beer. Many archeologists infer “that bread must therefore be an offshoot of beer making,” allowing bread to be stored in government facilities in times of famine. Beer in Mesopotamia must also have fulfilled an important social function as it does today. It was even used as currency and payment: “Sumerian temple workforce were issued a sila of beer a day—roughly equivalent to a liter.” (35) Beer allowed for the development of pottery, allowed Mesopotanians to develop bread, and allowed Mesopotamian society to fight off famine.	Egyptian beer was an important food; the development of beer allowed it to be used as both a nutritious food, a clean source of water, and a form of currency in Egypt, in addition to being of great cultural significance. In Egyptian literature, it “was mentioned more times than any other foodstuff,” (27) and “One Egyptian tale even credits beer with saving humankind from destruction” (27) from a ferocious sun goddess. In both Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was seen as an “ ancient, god-given drink that underpinned their existence, formed part of their cultural and religious identity, and had great social importance,” as it was drunk by all social classes. Like in Mesopotamia, beer was used as currency, and it was even used to pay taxes. As beer was much weaker in 4000 BC than it is today and it was made from boiled water, beer was both a clean source of hydration and a nutritious drink. In both Egypt and Mesopotamia, beer served a variety of purposes.	Like in Mesopotamia and Egypt, alcohol was of great religious significance and was a key staple in both Rome and Greece. Wine was drunk by all social classes, with date-palm wine being consumed by the lower classes and grape wine for the higher classes. They often drank wine at  special philosophical meetings known as  symposiums. Many important philosophers placed heavy emphasis on the symposium, with Plato arguing that “drinking with someone at a symposion is in fact the simplest, fastest, and most reliable test of someone's character.” When Rome “displaced the Greeks as the dominant power in the Mediterranean basin,” (54), they adopted many of the Greek customs, including their drinking habits. Wine became an important part of Roman religion, as wine was vital in Christian rituals.	Beer and wine had a profound influence on human society, especially in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Rome, and Greece. Beer allowed Mesopotamian society to develop bread, and allowed Mesopotamian society to fight off famine. The development of beer allowed it to be used as both a nutritious food source, a clean source of water, and a form of currency in Egypt, in addition to being of great cultural and religious significance.

human_15.txt,"In Orwell’s essay “Shooting an Elephant,” the narrator’s experience of shooting an aggressive elephant is a metaphor for colonialism. The dying elephant is a metaphor for Burma itself, as it was absorbed into the British Empire slowly and gradually. The narrator’s experience as a policeman whose actions were molded by native onlookers gives a glimpse into the head of an imperialist - and specifically on how people with power must act differently when they have an audience. Ultimately, the story reflects Orwell’s opinions on colonialism and imperialism by __________.	The description of the elephant may have been a metaphor for the slow and painful way that Burma was absorbed into the British Empire. Burma was initially not of much interest to the British, and neither was the elephant. The elephant was resting in a paddy field and seemed peaceful to the narrator, who felt that _________ . The elephant was shot three times by Orwell, and took several painful hours to die. There were three Anglo-Burmese wars, and it took a prolonged 62 years for Burma to become a British colony as the Konbaung dynasty fought bitterly to preserve their independence. The slow, agonizing death of the elephant is a metaphor for Burma’s process of becoming a British colony.	Orwell was forced into shooting the elephant due to his societal status - he is a white man in a colonial territory, and he must act like one. Although Orwell bitterly hates the local Burmese, he must impress them as to not be faced with ridicule or laughter from his supposed underlings, as well as to project an image of power and authority. Although he becomes doubtful of the need to shoot the elephant, he reasons that he must because “the crowd would laugh at [him]...., every white man’s life in the East, was one long struggle not to be laughed at.” The imperialist may think that he is in charge, but it is really his subjects that control him. This is demonstrated through the interaction between Orwell’s policeman, and the native inhabitants. The narrator’s experience as a policeman gives the reader the insight that people with power must act differently when they have an audience. Although in theory the imperialist has all the power, an imperialist must play the role of an imperialist. No matter how little the imperialist cares for their subjects, they will always care about how they are viewed by those they consider as beneath them and for this reason, they must always be “trying to impress” the natives. This colours every action they may make.  Like Orwell, they must become “only an absurd puppet pushed to and fro by the will of those yellow faces behind.” In Orwell’s essay “Shooting an Elephant,” the experience of Orwell as a police officer in British-controlled Burma is an analogy for colonialism in general. The aggressive elephant Orwell is driven into shooting three times is a metaphor for Burma and the three Anglo-Burmese wars. Orwell’s experiences give the reader insight into the effects and mindset of an imperialist, and the “real motives for which despotic governments act.” As those with power must care about how their perceived underlings see them, this colours their actions.",533,2659,0
human_16.txt,"The novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest by Ken Kensey has been criticized for its treatment of race and gender, for multiple reasons. It can be argued that it portrays a battle between positive masculine and negative feminine qualities. The men lack the positive masculine qualities they need to fight back and gain control over their lives, while the overly masculine “ball cutters” such as Nurse Ratchet control them. Ratchet’s black assistants reinforce the stereotype of those of african descent as suited for servitude. One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest is a product of its time, the late 50s, and contains many themes that can be considered racist or sexist.	In One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, many themes are portrayed as opposing dichotomies A problematic example is the struggle of masculinity against aggressive feminine power. Characters such as Chief Bromden’s father are emasculated by masculine women, causing them to gradually lose their positive masculine qualities, such as their self sufficiency and their pride. This is best represented by Chief Bromden, who lost his tribe, land, and eventually his identity as his mother convinced his father to sell the rights to his land. This culminates in the institutionaliation of Chief Bromden, where he is emasculated by Nurse Ratched and the institutional authorities. Chief Bromden is a character who has been heavily emasculated. The only masculine feature that remains is his tall height and his strength, which he is afraid to use to free himself	Nurse Ratched is the other side of the coin. Ratched is a dominant personality, a “buzzard, a ball-cutter,” who controls and emasculates the patients of the mental hospital how? Give an example (maybe something about Billy and how she is threatening him with telling his mom. She is a character with no redeeming qualities except her body, according to the patients and specifically McMurphy. It is obvious why this theme is politically problematic. Ratched is a powerful woman, but is portrayed as using that power sadistically/cruelly. The book also portrays masculine qualities in a positive light. The negative portrayal of reversed gender roles can be argued to be anti-feminist.	Nurse Ratchet’s “black boys” can be thought of as racist stereotypes. All of the orderlies are of African American descent. They are portrayed as nameless, blind followers of Ratched, who obey her every order. They are illiterate, promoting the idea that those of African American descent are less intelligent than their white counterparts. The blind cruelty and obedience of the orderlies can be seen as an affirmation of the stereotype that blacks are suited to servitude. 	The novel “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest” is a product of its time, and contains many problematic themes, such as the portrayal of power and the portrayal of people of colour. The portrayal of weak characters fighting back against feminine power and the portrayal of nameless servants of African American descent are highly problematic. Although Keysey may not have intended to portray feminine power as a negative and those of African American descent as nameless servants, he inadvertently includes ideas that are controversial in today’s world.

College will boost the economy by decreasing the national debt, and widening the workforce, and improvingimprove society by increasing equality.	Free college will boost the economy. Governor Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, who recently proposed a plan to make college free for all state residents, predicted that “Iin the long run, we’ll see improved economic growth, improved outcomes for New Mexican workers and families and parents.” More educated students would lead to a better paid workforce. A better paid workforce would lead to more money spent on the economy. More college degrees would lead to more citizens who are able to open new businesses, leading to an increase in jobs. 44 million Americans collectively hold more than $1.5 trillion in student debt, which is 1.5 trillion dollars not spent on the economy.

human_18.txt,"The life that the Lambert children lead up to Chapter 5 is worse than the life they lead as kids, but it is also in many ways better. The family initially appears fairly normal in Chapter 1, but their dysfunctionality is gradually revealed. While Alfred was initially a brilliant railroad engineer for Midland Atlantic, he eventually became a Parkinson's-riddled retiree with a deteriorating body. However, it is ironic that - as Alfred’s mental condition deteriorates - the family is actually brought closer, which shows that they are antithetical to the prototypical ‘American family’. Chapter 1 informs the reader of the deteriorating relationship of Enid and Alfred due to Alfred’s declining mental state. The children are estranged from their parents in part due to Alfred’s disciplinarian parenting style, a long shot from the traditional American nuclear family.  Alfred seems to suffer from a combination of early-onset dementia, “the audiologist had said that he was mildly impaired,” (7) and early-onset Alzheimer’s. They are departing for a Norweigan Cruise, but Alfred cannot seem to comprehend that they are departing Saturday and not today. 	Their relationship is strained, but outwardly appears normal.Alfred’s life was undoubtedly better in the past than now. Originally, “not onlyhad he worked long hours at the Midland Pacific Railroad and read aloud to his children and done the yard work and home maintenance and processed a nightly briefcase full of executive paper but had also found time to operate a serious metallurgical laboratory in the family basement, staying up past midnight to subject strange alloys to electrical and chemical stresses.” Alfred was originally a diligent worker, a caring father, and a mentally sharp metallurgist. However, after losing his job at Midland Pacific, he becomes more disciplinarian and less lucid. In the present day, he is a deteriorating body and mind.Denise seems to be the only one in the family who seems to be better off as an adult than as a child. Of the three siblings, she seems to be the most well-adjusted and capable. Although she has doubts about her sexuality, her life as a well-off and middle class cook is undoubtedly better than in a potentially abusive household under a mentally decaying father.  Ironically, as Denise is secretly a lesbian, she is the farthest off of the many family members from the idea of the American nuclear family, and yet she is the most stable and well-adjusted. The life the family leads is in many ways worse in the present day, but it is in some ways better. Enid and Alfred are at odds with each other, in part due to the fact that both Alfred’s mind and body are rotting away. The family is estranged from each other.

human_19.txt,"	The final quotation “Yet what is any ocean, but a multitude of drops?” in David Mitchel’s novel Cloud Atlas literally means that the ocean would not be the same without the impact of each individual drop. The world is composed of billions of individuals, but each individual has its own impact on the world. The most obvious proof of this interpretation is the structure of the novel. The novel is an anthology of stories across space and time. Although each protagonist lives on different continents, in different decades, or even hundreds of years apart - each protagonist is affected in some way or another by the actions of the previous protagonist. Another relevant argument is the recurring theme of popular movements. Adam Ewing joins the Abolitionist movement, while Sonmi-451 joins the Union. These people are miniscule drops among many, but are able to leave their own impacts in their own societies.	David Mitchel argues that although the world is composed of billions of human beings, the world would not be the same without each individual. Mitchel provides the metaphor of an ocean. Ewing’s life will amount “to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean,” but “yet what is any ocean but a multitude of drops?” The format of his novel provides substance to his interpretation. Each protagonist in Cloud Atlas affects the next protagonist - although they may be separated by hundreds of years and live across different continents,  without the previous protagonist, their stories would not be the same. The god of the primitives in “Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After” would not exist without the actions of Sonmi 451. You may feel miniscule, as you are just a single person in millions, but you will have your own impact on the world. We see this in how the novel portrays the effects of each of the protagonist’s actions. Somni-451’s attempt to assist the Union initially fails - but it is implied that her Declarations had a hand in “The Fall” and the creation of the post-apocalyptic society in “Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After.” Many protagonists attempt to impact the world in Cloud Atlas as individuals by joining popular movements. Somni-451 writes her Declarations in an attempt to inspire the many to rise up against the corporcracy system. Adam Ewing pledges to become an abolitionist and to commit his life to the freedom of slaves. Luisa Rey, a journalist, fights to uncover wrongdoing in a famous power plant in order to write a hit piece. These protagonists fight to have their own impact on the world, and these popular movements are an example of an impact one may have on the world as an individual.Finally, the meaning of the final quote of Cloud Atlas is that a single person can have their own impact on the world at large. The literal meaning behind “Yet what is any ocean, but a multitude of drops?” is that an ocean is composed of individual drops, but the ocean would not be the same without each drop. An ocean without the drops would be a dry wasteland. Likewise, our world is composed of billions of individuals - each with their own impact on the world. Somni-451’s attempt to assist the Union initially fails - but it is implied that her Declarations had a hand in “The Fall” and the creation of the post-apocalyptic society in “Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After.” In the course of the story “The Fall and the Near,” the main character moves from pessimism to optimism. First, he passes by a pastoral cottage in which lives a mother and her two daughters, who waves at her when he drives past. The engineer sees many horrible events in his line of work, and idealises this family. He retires, and decides to visit. However, this pastoral image of a family and a cottage which he structures his worldview around is shattered when he decides to visit the cottage.

human_20.txt,"Paradoxes and other logical fallacies are used effectively in order to satirize the absurdity of war. In Joseph Heller’s novel Catch-22, the titular paradox is one such example. Other paradoxes are also present in Catch-22 that highlight the absurdity of war. Paradoxes and illogical situations support Heller’s main theme that war is absurd, and that one must do anything to stay alive during war.	Catch-22 is a situation one cannot escape due to conflicting rules. One such example is the situation that keeps Yossarian and many of his colleagues from being discharged: While anyone crazy is eligible to be excused from combat duty, “anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn’t crazy” While “Orr was crazy and could be grounded,” “a concern for one’s own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind” (33). If Orr were to be asked to be discharged he would immediately be considered sane. These two conflicting pieces of information highlight the absurdity of war and its meaningless bureaucracy. 	Other logical paradoxes are also present in Catch-22. In Yossarian’s tent, there is Mudd, a “dead man” who had been killed in action before checking in and being processed as a member of the squadron. His belongings are in Yossarian’s tent, but no one can move them as Mudd has not yet officially arrived. Mudd cannot arrive as he has been killed. Mudd will never arrive and so his belongings are stuck in the tent. Catch-22 is an excuse used by the military police to justify kicking out the women living in Nately’s whore’s sister’s apartment. The police have the “right to do anything we can’t stop them from doing” (313). The MPs say that they are kicking the girls out because of Catch-22, but also cannot show them what Catch-22 is because the law Catch-22 forbids it. In a way, Yossarian is a paradox himself. He does the opposite of his job, yet his colleagues tolerate or even admire him.	Heller’s use of paradox is in support of his central theme of the absurdity of war. Yossarian’s antics go unpunished. Despite incontrovertible evidence of his misdeeds, he is never dismissed in petulance. This suggests that in the fog of war, one is able to do whatever it takes to stay alive. The insanity of the meaningless bureaucracy justifies Yossarian’s antics. In an illogical situation, Yossarian must stick to the logical idea that he must do as much as he can to avoid death. 	In Catch-22, the titualar paradox is used to satirize war and bureaucracies in general. Paradoxes and illogical situations illustrate the madness of war, and provide an excuse for Yossarian to attempt escape. The inescapable Catch-22 eventually is what drives Yossarian to desert at the end of the novel.",466,2278,0

However, Mark Antony’s speech is proven to be more convincing.Mark Antony uses sarcasm and contrast in order to turn public opinion against Brutus. He complements both Brutus and Caesar in order to contrast them. He informs the public of Caesar’s many deeds as proof of his love for the people of Rome. Caesar “brought many captives home to Rome / Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill,” and in his final will, he granted his inheritance to the people of Rome. He sarcastically repeats that Brutus is “an honourable man,” the only defence he gives of Brutus and the conspirators.

Omens appear often and are accurate, but the main characters do not heed them. The conspirators do not regard omens and fate when they appear. Fate is proven to exist, and the omens are eventually shown to be correct. It is possible to argue that they have become victims of fate despite their own free will.Omens are often depicted in Julius Caesar. A soothsayer famously states ““Beware the ides of March” to Caesar, informing him of the date of his assasination. However, he does not heed this warning, even . When he sees the soothsayer on the day of his death, he defiantly replies: “The ides of March are come.” Caesar and the main characters consciously make the decision to ignore the omens.The omens are in many cases prophetic. The famous “Ides of March” is proven to be true. The night before the assisniation, omens become common: An owl is seen at noon; meteors are seen; volcanic activity is observed. These omens foresee the fates of the conspirators. Caesar’s wife Calpurnia says that in a dream, she sees “blood upon the Capitol;/The noise of battle hurtled in the air,/Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,/And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets./ O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,/And I do fear them.” (Act 2 scene 3)”  This accurately predicts civil war as a result of the death of Caesar. Fate is a prominent theme in Julius Caesar.The characters of Julius Caesar are victims of fate in an almost self-contradicting way. Bothaesar and the conspirators to murder Caesar are heavily exposed to omens, but they either interpret them in an incorrect manner, or consciously ignore them.

human_24.txt,"Cassius utilizes a variety of strategies in manipulating Brutus into treason in Act 1 Scene 2 of William Shakespeare’s play Julius Caesar. Cassius primarily utilizes flattery, especially in relation to his high social status in the Roman Republic. He then takes advantage of Brutus’s almost naive trust in the Roman populace, forging letters and petitions supposedly from regular citizens of the Roman republic, causing him to fall for one of the earliest ever recorded cases of a phishing campaign. Cassius continues to manipulate Brutus throughout acts two and three. Cassius uses flattery and forgery in order to turn Brutus’s loyalty from Caesar to Cassius.Cassius appeals to Brutus’s ego. He assures him that regular Romans hold him in high regard. However, as “no such mirrors will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye / That you might see your shadow,” (Act 1 Scene 1) Brutus cannot see this respect that Romans feel towards him. Cassius then attempts to convince Brutus that even his colleagues hold him in high regard, and they too detest Caesar’s rule. He finally attempts to convince Brutus that he is equal to Caesar, as his ancestors founded Rome: “O, you and I have heard our fathers say / There was a Brutus once that would have booked / Th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome / s easily as a king.” This heritage makes Brutus’s grudge personal, as his ancestor was the one who overthrew the last tyrannical Roman king.Cassius forges letters expressing suspicions about Caesar, and instructs Cinna to leave them in places for Brutus to find: “Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper, And look you lay it in the praetor’s chair / Where Brutus may but find it.” (Act 1 Scene 3) He takes advantage of Brutus’s naivety and gullibility to turn Brutus against Caesar, building upon the respect Brutus now believes the Roman populace holds towards him.Cassius continues to manipulate Brutus throughout Acts 2 and 3 in order to ensure his loyalty stays towards Cassius. In act 2, Brutus’s loyalty completely shifts away from Caesar, guaranteeing his loyalty to Cassius and the other conspirators. When this occurs, Cassius says, “Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see / Thy honorable mettle may be wrought / From that it is disposed of. Therefore it is met That noble minds keep ever with their likes, For who so firm that cannot be seduced?” (Act 1 scene 2)” Everyone can be manipulated, even one as respectable and honest as Brutus.Act 1 is the point in which Cassius changes Brutus’s loyalty from Caesar to his conspiracy to commit sedition. Cassius utilizes forward-thinking tactics such as flattery and phishing. He inflates Brutus’s ego by comparing him with the more successful Caesar, and by making reference to his familial heritage. This heritage makes Brutus’s grudge a personal one. The significance of Act 1.2 is that the conspiracy is set into motion, guaranteeing Caesar’s death.",488,2430,0
human_25.txt,"One flew over the cuckoo's nest, by Ken Kesy has sometimes been criticized for its depiction and treatment of race and gender. While some of this is unfair criticism, there is good reason for some of the things that some may find offensive today. The depiction of people of other races and Nurse Ratched, both of which are very controversial portrayals today, is based on portrayals of women and ethnic minorities that can be considered negative or stereotyped. First of all, One flew over the cuckoo's nest was written back in a time when blacks were denied many of the same rights as whites, and the traditional role of women as housekeepers was considered a cultural norm. In fact, when the book was written, it was in response to what is now considered barbaric practices in mental institutions, like lobotomy and electroshock therapy. At the time when it was written, the Civil Rights movement, drug culture and feminism were all happening in the zeitgeist. Ken Kesly’s book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest contains elements from all of these, both good and bad. This when read from a modern day standpoint, makes the book controversial for some. One flew over the Cuckoo's nest deals with sensitive subjects such as racism and sexism. Specifically, the reader can see the unflattering depiction of Nurse Ratchet’s black orderlies as a point of contention. The depiction of the black boys as the minions or sadistic underlings of a white woman might offend some people today.  Some might even consider it to be racist, specifically over how Ratched believed that blacks clean the wards better than Whites. “All of them black as telephones. The blacker they are, she learned from that long dark row that came before them, the more time they are likely to devote to cleaning and scrubbing and keeping the ward in order.” This implies that blacks are only good for cleaning, and somehow equates that to their skin colour. As this book was published in 1962, from a modern day perspective, it is easy to see why this is considered racist. Gender also plays a large role in the controversial nature of this book. An easy example of this would be Billy Bibbit. His boyish state results from a fear of women, especially women who are in power. This emasculating effect is not just limited to Bibbit, who is especially afraid of Ratchet. Rrenches, the head nurse of the ward, uses her emasculating effect against her patients. As summarised by Mcmurphy, “No, that nurse ain’t some kinda monster chicken, buddy, what she is is a ball-cutter. I’ve seen a thousand of ’em, old and young, men and women. Seen ’em all over the country and in the homes - people who try to make you weak so they can get you to toe the line, to follow their rules, to live like they want you to.” Ratched exists to represent the  emasculation of men in society. The depiction of a powerful woman causing men to become emasculated can suggest that the book is sexist. One could argue, however, that people are focusing too much on the sexism aspect instead of the cruelty against her patients, especially when she causes Billy to kill himself. In conclusion, thanks to the contents of this story, it is easy to characterise some parts of this novel as racist and sexist. While the book was written almost 58 years ago, it isn’t so simple as brushing off these complaints as merely being views from the time where it was written. We need to understand why such portrayals were part of the accepted societal and literary landscape at the time. However, I still see this book as merely being a good story. ",628,2948,0
human_26.txt,"Oliver Burkeman argues that a pessimistic worldview is the key to success and personal contentment in his The Guardian article “Happiness is a Glass Half Empty.” Burkeman begins with delineating the modern mantra that to be successful, one must be “Be positive, look on the bright side, stay focused on success.” Using a multitude of examples, such as that of the Museum of Failed Products, he disproves this idea. He compares this mantra to his claim that “the true path to contentment is to learn to be a loser,” and proves his mantra by pointing to examples of Japanese and greco-roman philosophy. By arguing for a pessimistic worldview, Burkeman provides the reader with a method of achieving success and to prepare oneself for the inevitability of failure.	Oliver Burkeman begins by describing, then arguing against, the modern mantra that one must stay focused on success and positivity. He provides the example of the “Graveyard of Capitalism,” the Museum of Failed Products. It exhibits thousands upon thousands of products “withdrawn from sale after a few weeks or months.” The curator, Carol Sherry, informs the reader that all of the products on display are created by “real people who sincerely want to do their best, and then, well, things happen.” Optimism does not protect one from unforeseen obstacles.” Optimism and blind focus on the end product may even blind oneself from lessons learned from past failures. “Product developers are so focused on their next hoped-for success…” that they have been “surprised to discover products that their own companies had created, then abandoned.” Over “90% of products fail,” and product designers and marketers must confront it - but don’t. Not only is the modern approach of focusing on “things going right” inefficient, it may be emotionally damaging and may even hurt one’sown chances of success.	After warning against blind optimism, one must contend with the fact that 90% of products fail, and so one must be comfortable and familiar with failure. He provides the example of a trial conducted by the German psychologist Garbielle Oettingen involving a group of “mildly dehydrated subjects”. One group visualized “positive fantasies about the future,” while the other did not. While the first group “experienced a significant reduction in their energy levels,” they were not motivated to hydrate themselves. They “have confused imagining success with having already achieved it.” This experiment proved that positive visualization is counterproductive to success - or at least the perception of it.Finally, Burkeman advocates for a “”negative path” to happiness.” Burkman advocates a philosophy akin to Stoicism in its place. Stoics acknowledge that “things will not turn out for the best,” and by imagining one’s worst fears, they “turn bottomless, nebulous fears into finite and manageable ones”.  This generates a “vastly more dependable calm” as opposed to the decrease in motivation optimists may suffer from. By providing an example from greco-roman philosophy, Burkeman disproves then provides an effective alternative to blind focus on success.Oliver Burkeman compares two differing worldviews on achieving success: optimism and stoicism. He then reminds the reader of the inevitability of failure with the example of the Museum of Failed Products, a vast repository of consumer products that failed to sell. He then informs the reader of the “Positivity Bias,” which is the fact that one with “positive fantasies about the future” will eventually lose motivation to achieve their own goals, informing the reader of the decreased efficiency of optimism. Finally, Burkeman invokes an example from greco-roman philosophy as a replacement for optimism: Stoicism. The famous Stoic Seneca “actively dwelled on worst-case scenarios instead,”, which serves to harden himself from failure. By comparing two competing worldviews, he instructs the reader on how to achieve success.",614,3329,0
human_27.txt,"The novel Atlas Cloud by David Mitchel is presented in a unique anthology format of six interconnected stories across time and space, in order to create an overarching timeline. All stories are set in wildly different places, but all six narratives share both thematic and literary connections to the previous narratives. They all share the themes of death, deception, and reincarnation. However, other intertextual characteristics are also utilized in order to bridge the stories into an overarching narrative. The concept of death and reincarnation is explored in the six short stories. Autua, from “The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing,” is to be executed but is rescued by Adam Ewing. Ewing is poisoned by Dr.Goose in order to test his philosophy of “eat or be eaten.” In “Letters from Zedelghem,” the musician Froboiser kills himself after he completes his Cloud Atlas Sextet and a woman rejects him. Death and reincarnation serve a purpose in Cloud Atlas: They provide a bridge for the reader to different periods in time and space. The reincarnation of Froboiser as Louisa connects the story of “Half Lives” to “Letters from Zedelghem. The similar fates of Adam Ewing, Luisa Ray, and Timothy Cavendish bridge their individual stories together. Death and reincarnation link the six scenarios together.Lies, corruption, and deception are prominent themes in Atlas Cloud. Each protagonist is subject to lies and corruption. Ewing is nearly killed by Goose, and is forced to live with the corrupt crew of the ship. Ayrs co-opts Froboiser’s work. Sixsmith investigates a corrupt nuclear power plant, but is killed in a suspicious manner. It is hinted that Luisa is killed by agents working for the power plant. With Cavendish, by having an affair with his brother’s wife, he betrays his brother. Lies and corruption thematically connect the stories together by showing their ubiquity across time and spaceOther intertextual characteristics occasionally link the stories to each other. The fabricant Somni-451 inspired the god of the tribe of the valleymen. Occasionally, Mitchell breaks the fourth wall. Cloud Atlas is the name of the composition Froboisher makes. “Half Lives” and “Letters from Zedelghem” share a direct connection. Sixsmith is told by Froibisher that he will “meet again.” In “Half Life,” Sixsmith is befriended by Luisa, a reincarnation of Froibisher. Sonmi-451 directly inspired God Sonmi, the god of the Vallyemen. Luisa Ray hears “Cloud Atlas Sextet,” the final work of Froboisher in “Half Life 2.” Not only are the stories connected thematically, they are also connected directly. This serves to elevate the theme of reincarnation.  In “Cloud Atlas,” the six stories are connected both thematically and directly in order to create an overarching narrative. The initial four stories are all plagued by the themes of deception, death, lies, and corruption. Mitchel weaves together six stories in varying periods across time and space. They are set in vistas including post-apocalyptic Hawaii, Korea in the far future, the eighteenth-century Cayman Islands, by different protagonists. Mitchel successfully utilities thematic and direct similarities in six tales in order to tell an overarching narrative about connection.",507,2735,0

In both stories, Nature is depicted as a vicious and uncaring force, and protagonists succumb to death after their own arrogance. However, the antagonists of both stories are not Nature, but themselves. Due to the fact that both deaths are preventable, the two stories teach the reader of the importance of preparation.In both Into the Fire and “To Build a Wild,” the protagonists succumb to their own arrogance. Both believe that they can conquer the wild, and are eager to endure the wilderness, but underestimate the threat and succumb to death in the bleak wasteland of the Arctic circle. They ignore advice from the locals. McCandless ignores the advice of Gallien, and the protagonist of Into the Fire ignores the words of the old man living at Sulfur Creek, showing clear contempt for those more experienced than him, saying that “Those old men were rather womanish,” and makes fatal mistakes. In “To Build a Wild,” McCandless shows contempt for his own future, saying that “I don’t want to know what day it is or where I am.” Both protagonists, due to their large egos, succumbed to the wilderness, proving that nature is uncaring.Both characters die in a similar way. Despite his pious devotion to the ideals of Jack London and Throeau, McCandless starves to death at the hands of a harsh and uncaring natural world. The protagonist of Into the Fire dies due to his optimism and his disdain for those with more experience. Both protagonists pass away due to their pride and misplaced confidence in their own abilities. Both McCandless and the unnamed man die without regret.

He expectedly starves to death as a result. The man in “To Build a Fire” purposefully enters the cold night alone to prove himself, then freezes to death. However, both characters accept their fate. The man contemplates that “You were right, old fellow. You were right,” while McCandless writes a peaceful journal entry. This proves that Nature is vicious.

McCandless, an archetypical adventure seeker, aimed to create an identity of “Alexander Supertramp,” and sought to construct a personal narrative of himself traveling across America with no material possessions. He is driven by a distrust for authority, a love for freedom, and a dangerously romanticized view of nature. McCandless’s dangerous overconfidence results in his eventual death.	Chris McCandless is an archetypical adventure seeker. His desire to live with nature is due to his distrust of authority, such as his parents, as well as a love for freedom, and an idealized view of nature. Motivated by writers such as Jack London, Tolstoy, and Roseau, he sought to flee from responsibility and his parents, by donating or selling his possessions and moving in a world untainted by modern society: the Alaskan wilderness. He idealized the idea of being a “tramp,” a vagrant, and possessed dangerous overconfidence. He throws away his watch, saying that “I don’t want to know what day it is or where I am. None of that matters.” Adventure seekers seem to distrust authority, emphasise personal freedom, and seem to desire to escape from society.	Many adventure seekers seek to create an identity and personal narrative. McCandless assumed the identity of “Alexander Supertramp” and planned to travel across the United States while “invent[ing] an utterly new life for himself” and becoming “a master of his own destiny.” This was a result of the romantic culture American society has constructed around nature, a culture that drove many into the bleak and desolate wasteland of Alaska. The character of Gallien has met many “crackpots from the lower forty-eight who come north to live out ill-considered Jack London fantasies,” but discover that “the bush is an unforgiving place, however, that cares nothing for hope or longing.” McCandless and many others discovered this too late to survive.	Romanticization of nature may lead to not only the death of the occasional lunatic, but it may also lead to serious societal misdemeanors such as terrorism, as was the case of MIT proffessor Ted Kaczynski. Like McCandless, he possessed a distrust of authority. Like McCandless, he lived an ascetic life in nature away from others and sought “to live independent of modern technology.” Like McCandeless, he was intelligent, and succeeded academically.

He undergoes a series of trials and challenges as he travels across America, working in two restaurants, a grain elevator, and a ranch. In search of a revelation, he refuses help from a mentor and plans an idealistic foray into an Alaskan provincial park.

McCandeless undergoes trials and challenges, archetypical of the prototypical hero. However, his ultimate demise nullifies any idea that he fulfils the final requirement of a hero, which is transcendence. 	McCandelless’s demise corresponds to the death and rebirth stage of the mono-myth. However, he is not supernaturally saved, as he dies of malnutrition over a period of 113 days on a well travelled trail. His demise is directly caused by his idealism. “I don’t want to know what time it is. I don’t want to know what day it is or where I am,” he says. If he had brought a compass or map, he would likely have returned to civilization in the river crossing a mere 3 miles away from his bus. This demonstrates dangerous hubris causing overconfidence. His needless and preventable demise does not correspond to the hero’s journey.McCandleless’s journey to his death was not romantic and idealistic, it was selfish. Blinded by his ideals of Tolstoy and Rosseau, he abandons his family and takes an ill informed journey into the Alaskan wilderness, greatly worrying his parents. His sudden disappearance leaves his family guilty that they “did not see the signs.” Although many parts of the story of Christopher McCandelless align with the Mono-Myth, he is not a hero, for his completely preventable demise emotionally devastated his family. Frank, the Vietnam veteran who saw him like a son, returned to alcoholism after hearing of his demise.

Second, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man shows the journey of Stephen Dedalus as he becomes a man, illustrated by his growth as an artist. Starting as a boy in a private school, he goes through multiple stages, first engaging in debauchery: ““He wanted to sin with another of his kind, to force another being to sin with him and to exult with her in sin.” (67)”, Dedalus then becomes a religious fanatic after hearing a sermon by Father Arnell. “He flung the blankets from him madly to free his face and neck. That was his hell. God had allowed him to see the hell reserved for his sins: stinking, bestial, malignant, a hell of lecherous goatish fiends. For him! For him!”(91) Dadulaus eventually has an epiphany when he comes to a balance between his life and religion after seeing a girl on a beach. He exclaims: “—Heavenly God! cried Stephen’s soul, in an outburst of profane joy.” (113) Dadalus’s coming of age as an artist comes when he learns to balance his artistic needs with his religion. Daedalus’s coming of age exposes the beauty of the world around him. Finally, Dadulus and Araby’s coming of age are very different from each other. While Araby comes of age realising the boredom of his life, Daedalus’s epiphany consists of him realizing how beautiful the world around him is. In addition, the growth that they experience is also different. Araby realises his boredom and dreams of change, while Dadulus experiences his growth as an artist. The two men’s coming of age share almost no similarities. In conclusion, the two mens growth and coming of age are very different. While Araby releases his boredom and aspirations to change, Daedalus does so by realising the beauty around him, and thus striking a balance between his art and his religion. - meeting of imagination and realityIn the short story Araby by James Joyce, the meeting of imagination and reality is a central theme. The main character’s imagination of a bazaar filled with exotic goods from the middle east is shattered by reality when he finds out that they are all products from England, thus making him realize the boredom of his life, as well as reveals his idealised view of the middle east, and the girl. “Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.” (p5). The meeting of imagination and reality causes Araby to realise the boredom of his life. ",658,3045,0

Biff and Happy want to be successful businessmen, like who they perceive their parents to be. However, they are both considered failures by their father, WIlly, who attempts to emulate the success of his role model David Singleman. He pursues the American Dream, the idea that anyone in America can become successful if they work hard. Linda Loman, the mother, tries to fill the role of a mother in a nuclear family. Although he is under financial troubles, he tries to upkeep the facade that he is a successful businessman. 	Biff is seen as a failure and underachiever by his father. However, the reason he is seen as such is due to the fact that Willy broke his illusion of success and the American Dream. He discovers WIlly’s mistress, causing him to lose his belief in his father’s image of a perfect facade and causing him to lose his ambitions and lose faith in his father’s goals for him. Instead, he seeks to live a pastoral life. He wants to buy a ranch, and “raise cattle, use our muscles.” He wants to move away from Willy’s vision of success and become independent.	Happy Loman is Biff’s younger brother. He is willing to accept his father’s image of himself. He fully believes in his father, and seeks to become like him, preventing his escape from his father’s ambition for him. However, this results in Happy inheriting Willy’s extraordinary skill of self-deception. He deludes himself into believing his father as a success, and vows to move to New York. He is doomed to fall into the same trap as his father. He is motivated by the fact that he tries to impress his father.	Willy, the father, tries to become successful by following the American Dream. He believes that success is tied to how likeable he is. His greatest desire is embodied in the name of his son, Happy. His favorite mantra, “The jungle is dark, but full of diamonds,” describes the facade of success he tries to upkeep to his family. He can not see that he is a failure, seeming to be on the verge of a mental breakdown, because of his desire to fulfill the American Dream, like his neighbor David Singleman, and his brother Ben.

human_37.txt,"In the play Death of a Salesman, the interpretations of the death of Willy Loman differ from character to character. Willy, Biff, and Happy have different interpretations of Willy’s death. To Happy, WIlly was a martyr. His death inspires him into going into Sales. To Biff, he is ‘set free’ by his father’s death. To Biff, Willy was not a martyr, due to the fact that he had “The wrong dreams.” Ultimately, Biff is the correct one, as martyrs are usually remembered positively, and Willy is remembered negatively.To Biff, Willy was not a martyr. To Biff, Willy was a misguided individual who “had the wrong dreams,” who “never knew who he was,” which was a failure. Although he stands to gain from Willy’s death, Biff pities him. Due to Willy’s death, Biff has broken free from WIlly’s delusions, and is free to pursue his own dreams. From Willy’s life insurance, Biff would be able to pursue his dream of buying a ranch in the West. Noting that his father loved working with his hands, “there’s more of him in that front stoop than in all the sales he ever made,”  Biff believes that Willy should have long since switched careers.

human_38.txt,"In One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,  The Chief is a classic example of an unreliable narrator. He is mentally ill, and somehow believes that the world is controlled by a machine called the Combine. As such, he is unfit to be a reliable narrator. First, it is clear that Chief Bromdem is mentally ill. He is admitted to the mental institution as a deaf and a mute, but it is clear that he suffers from other disorders as well. Chief Bromden has frequent hallucinations, perhaps from the pills that he is made to consume. He frequently hallucinates about fog, especially when distressed. “he becomes hysterical and starts hallucinating a thick fog, cold snow coming down. Bromden can hear Nurse Ratched rushing towards him through the thick of it, and he’s pinned down and sedated. “ Brombden’s hallucinations prevent him from being a reliable narrator, as they call into question any of the observations that he makes in the novel. Second, Chief Bromden most likely suffers from some form of post traumatic stress disorder, which I believe is why he was institutionalized in the first place. Chief bromden is both deaf and mute, both of which can be effects from PTSD. When Bromden was a child, his tribe's land was sold to make place for a hydroelectric dam. He watched his father become pressured into selling, all while he couldn’t do anything. This experience, combined with his time in the Army, leads to the PTSD which he suffers from. Bromden’s past experiences in life make him unusable as a narrator, as he is not objective or trustworthy. Third, the main character believes in dangerous conspiracy theories. Chief Bromdem thinks that the world is ruled by “the combine”, a machine that controls society. He thinks that the mental institution that he inhabits, is where the Combine sends people to be fixed. “Across the room from the Acutes are the culls of the Combine’s product, the Chronics. Not in the hospital, these, to get fixed, but just to keep them from walking around the streets giving the product a bad name.” When a patient is cured, Bromden later claims: “A success, they say, but I say he’s just another robot for the Combine and might be better off as a failure, like Ruckly sitting there fumbling and drooling over his picture.”  It is unfortunate that his misguided belief in his conspiracies makes an unreliable narrator.  His unreliability makes it difficult for the reader to fully trust their observations and intuition about characters - making it difficult to enjoy. In conclusion, thanks to Chief Bromden’s mental state, he is an extremely unreliable narrator. This, compounded with his isolation from the outside world thanks to his institutionalisation, leads him to come up with outlandish conspiracy theories. ",466,2283,0
human_39.txt,"In the short story “The Fall of the House of Usher”, author Edgar Allen Poe creates suspense and tension by creating an air of uncertainty around the characters, using traditional gothic horror setpieces such as a haunted mansion, and symbols of doubles to create an impression of suspicion and suspense in the reader.  First, Poe creates an air of ambiguity by restricting the amount of information that the reader has about the main character’s situation. The narrator’s friend’s request is unclear and ambiguous--he does not give the narrator the exact nature of his disease. In addition, the narrator reveals that he knows little about his friend. The narrator reflects: “Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend.” The reader is left in the dark about the true nature of his friend, and it is later revealed that the Usher family “lay in the direct line of descent.” The entire bloodline is incestuous, further arousing suspision in the reader that something is amiss. The lack of information and suspicious bloodline serve to create an air of suspense and tension in the reader.  Secondly, Poe invokes traditional aspects of gothic horror, such as the haunted mansion, and the undead. The usage of crumbling gothic mansions like the House of Usher is a traditional part of the Gothic Horror genre. For example, the narrator describes the House of Usher: “There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart --an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime.” Poe’s usage of depressing gothic mansions builds suspense and tension in readers familiar with Gothic horror. The usage of the gothic setting climaxes with another familiar gothic horror trope, the undead. Poe writes: “-but then without those doors there DID stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher.” Depictions of being buried alive, death, and madness are common among gothic horror. Poe’s use of gothic horror elements such as a crumbling mansion, and being buried alive contributes to the audience's expectations, and leads to the climax of the story. Finally, Poe creates an air of uncertainty by having a heavy theme of doubles. The house of Usher is first depicted as a reflection. For example: “I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down” The reflection of the House of Usher gives the impression of a vacant face. Another example of Poe’s doppelgangers is between Roderick and Madeline Usher. The narrator comments on the striking similarity between the two, revealing them to be twins. He comments: “A striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention.” The premature burial of Madeline Usher and revealing of the two as twins foreshadows the ending of the story in which they simultaneously die in each other’s arms, elevating the tension felt in the reader. In conclusion, Poe creates an air of impression of suspicion and tension by restricting the reader's access to information, by using traditional aspects of gothic horror, and by using dopplegangers. The incestuous bloodline of the Ushers, haunted mansion, and symbols of doubles climaxes at the end, when Madeline Usher kills her brother, destroying the Usher bloodline and the mansion itself.

human_41.txt,"In the essay “Happiness is a glass half empty”, author Oliver Burkman argues that focusing on failure will lead to better results than focusing on success. Using examples such as the Museum of Failed Products, anecdotes, and science, Burkman argues that people should embrace failure, removing the need to stress about making the right choices, and learning to be a loser. Burkman uses the Museum of Failed Products to emphasize the frequency of failure. He writes:““Most products fail.” According to some estimates, the failure rate is as high as 90%.” The frequency of failures is further emphasised when the origins of the museum are explained: “Its creator, a now-retired marketing man named Robert McMath, merely intended to accumulate a “reference library” of consumer products, not failures per se.” Using the Museum of Failed Products, Burkmen informes readers of the frequency of failure, creating the image that it is much more common than people think. Using science, Burkman reveals that by embracing and actively thinking of success, human motivation to succeed decreases. German psychologist Gabriele Oettngen’s experiments show that “spending time and energy focusing on how well things could go... has emerged, actually reduces most people’s motivation to achieve them.” By focusing on success, the brain subconsciously believes that it has already achieved the goals, reducing motivation to actually achieve the goals. A positive thinking culture can often blind people from failure. A system that treats failure like a plague, wherein failure is swept under the rug without a post-mortem cannot avoid the same problem in the future. Burkman writes: “Perhaps nobody wanted to contemplate the prospect of failure; perhaps someone did, but didn’t want to bring it up for discussion … Little energy will have been invested in discovering what went wrong; everyone involved will have conspired, perhaps without realising what they’re doing, never to speak of it again.” Positive thinking culture leads to failure becoming an unacceptable outcome.In conclusion, Burkman’s essay “Happiness is a glass half empty” uses the Museum of Failed Products, science, and anecdotes to inform the reader about the dangers of a solely-positive thinking culture. By emphasizing the frequency of failure, using science to explain why, and using anecdotes, Happiness is a Glass Half Empty convincingly proves the superiority of pessimism.            ",387,2060,0

human_43.txt,"In the novel Cloud Atlas, author David Mitchell connects six separate stories and weaves them into a coherent narrative. Using shared elements across all six narratives, the reader can interpret and understand the relationships between these stories. Death, lies, and reincarnation are themes that connect all six stories.Death and killing is a common theme between all stories. The main characters of The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing, Letters from Zeldghem, Half Lives, and The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish all share the possibility of their death in a variety of ways. Adam Ewing, Luisa Ray, and Timothy Cavandish face death at the hands of others, which they escape from. Robert Frobisher however, kills himself after he finishes his Cloud Atlas Sextet. The way that each character interacts with death helps to interlink the different narratives. All characters in these stores share similar characteristics, relating to the idea of reincarnation. Author David Mitchell himself has stated that every character in the narrative is a reincarnation of their previous lives, and possesses memories as well as physical characteristics. All characters in Cloud Atlas share the same birthmark. Mitchell writes:“Luisa shunts these aside to get a clearer view of a birthmark between her shoulder blade and collarbone… But it is undeniably shaped like a comet. The mirror mists over.” (Half-Lives, p57) These characters also experience deja vu in between the different stories. For example, when Robert Frobisher’s Cloud Atlas Sextet is played at the end of Half Lives, Ray believes that she has heard it before: ““Where have I heard it before?” The young man shrugs. “Can’t be more than a handful in North America.” “But I know it. I’m telling you I know it.”” (Half Lives, p192). The reincarnation and deja vu of the different characters connects the different narratives.Lies, deception, and corruption are all themes shared between the first four narratives. Every character in Atlas Shrugged is subject to these themes. Ewing is betrayed and almost killed by Goose, Frobisher’s work is almost co-opted by Ayrs, and Ray, while investigating the Seaboard Company, is almost killed. The narrative approach to Cavendish’s story is more light hearted, as he betrayed his brother in the past, leading to his confinement in Aurora House. These shared themes of lies, deception and corruption between the four stories help to connect the different narratives. In conclusion, author David Mitchell uses common themes of death, lies, and deception, as well reincarnation, to weave together six different narratives. The similar themes and experiences between the different characters allows Mitchell to create a coherent and easy to understand story. ",431,2318,0
human_44.txt,"In Tennessee Williams's play A Streetcar named desire, symbolism and metaphor take a very prominent role. Bathing takes a prominent role throughout the play, representing Blanche's attempt to cleanse her past, and for Stanly to calm his violent temper. Throughout the play, the reader is constantly reminded of this motif.Blanche’s bathing represents her attempt to cleanse herself of her past. Rather than be candid about her past, she camouflages it from herself and from the people that she meets. Stella tells Stanley: “She’s soaking in a hot tub to quiet her nerves. She’s terribly upset.” (Scene one, p24) Blanche’s bathing serves to cleanse herself of her past, but also to hide her past from others. Stanly’s bathing serves to calm his vivacity and violent temper. After beating Stella, he showers, and feels remorseful, calls for Stella to return.: “[Finally, Stanley stumbles half dressed out to the porch and down the wooden steps to the pave-ment before the building. There he throws back his head like a baying hound and bellows his wife’s name:” (Scene three p53) Stella returns to Stanley, further cultivating the motif of the calming effects of bathing. Both of these motifs invoke similar themes, the calming and cleansing effects of bathing. Blanche’s bathing seeks to calm and cleanse herself from her past. Stanly uses bathing to quench his smoldering anger after the poker game. While the purpose of bathing is different for these two characters, with Blanche using it to abscond from her past, and Stanley’s showering to debilitate his anger and to uncork his decorum. In conclusion, Stanley and Blanche’s bathing both serve similar purposes.

Many sports, such as American football, will cause neurodegenerative disease. Sports cause dangerous attitudes of tribalism. There have been incidents of sports fans committing property damage. Finally, sports will incite or inflame civil unrest, as proved by the Nika Revolt and Formula 1 in Bahrain. Sports are a waste of time, and should be discouraged. In order to protect our children, we should ban sports.Sports can and will cause dangerous injuries. Neurological damage is common. Over 253 high school players and 34 college players have suffered permanent injuries to their spinal cord from playing football, and over 84% of football players suffer CTE, a traumatic brain disorder caused by impacts to the head. By participating in team sports, players are exposed to pandemics. All 20 members of an American high school sports team tested positive for Coronavirus on December 7. With the peer pressure often associated with team sports, the likelihood of injuries increases. Due to the highly social nature of team sports, fights have been known to erupt between rival hockey teams.  Sports should be banned as they have been known to cause physical harm such as neurodegenerative disease.The social aspect of team sports causes risk. Players may be pressured into doing things they often would not have done. Hazing and drug use have been known to occur within college sports teams. Sports players may pressure themselves to perform outside of their physical ability, causing injuries. The boxer Mike Towell succumbed to brain bleed in the finals of a boxing competition, due to his desire to “fight to the end.” The tribalism of competitive sport promotes a dangerous “us versus them” mentality in fans. The Nika Revolt of 532 was a revolt instigated between the two largest chariot teams in Byzantium, the “Blues” and the “Greens.” The riots between fans of both chariot teams eventually ignited deeply embedded civil unrest and an attempt to overthrow the emperor. The social aspect of sport is inherently dangerous to not only players but also fans.The implications of sport may even extend to the audience. An example can be found in Formula One. Recently, the sport was plunged into controversy for proposing a race in Saudi Arabia, a country well known for human rights abuses, and reigniting controversy over races in countries with a record of human rights abuses like Russia, China, USA, Bahrain, and most recently, Saudi Arabia. By racing in these countries, Formula One Management (FOM) is helping to cover up these human rights abuses with the practice of Sportswashing. For example, in 2012, Formula One held a race in Bahrain even though just outside the race track there were mass protests relating to the Arab Spring. With the slogan of the race being “Unified: One nation in celebration”, the Formula One race created the image that all was well inside the country. Sports are inherently dangerous, and should be banned. Sports will cause dangerous physical injuries, such as brain injuries and spreading diseases. Sports also generates tribalism, which may inflame social issues or cause players to succumb to peer pressure. Sports may even incite dangerous social unrest, such as the protests incited by Formula 1’s 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix.

human_48.txt,"In the United States, suicide is the second-highest cause of death for teenagers. In 2019 for example,  2600 teenagers were among the more than 47000 victims of suicide.  While suicide is a complicated issue that should not be summarised in a short essay, it is still an important issue that can be looked at.Suicide victims often have a mental illness or psychiatric diagnosis, family history of suicide and/or exposure to suicide.  A common reason for suicide is after suffering a traumatic event, such as substance abuse, and physical or sexual abuse. Another factor of suicide for people between the age of 10 -19 is impulsivity or aggressive behaviour, and a lack of social skills or social isolation. Other reasons may include physical illness and disruptions in the family, such as a divorce or legal issues. Victims of suicide often suffer a combination of these factors.The rate of suicide among teenagers can be reduced if the reasons leading to suicide can be eliminated or reduced.  For example, a common occurrence when someone commits suicide is the formation of a suicide cluster, where a person committing suicide serves as a trigger which causes more suicides in the area around the victim. By addressing some of the issues that cause suicide, the suicide cluster can be eliminated and the overall number so suicides can be reduced. Methods of addressing the factors which often lead to suicide can be broad. For example, support for those with previous histories of physical and sexual abuse or with mental illness can be improved by the state subsidizing psychiatrists and by destigmatizing the conversation around suicide. For instance, Catholicism considers suicide to be a grave sin, which can stifle conversations around suicide and deter people from seeking help.  Another factor that can be addressed is social isolation, something that has been increasing during the pandemic. Schools can implement more in-person events and promote social interaction. By implementing a few measures, the number of suicides can be dramatically reduced. In conclusion, suicide is a complicated issue that cannot be adequately covered in a short essay. Victims of suicide often suffer from a combination of issues, which should be properly addressed to reduce the number of victims of suicide. In short, more resources should be put into the adequate treatment of people who have previously suffered traumatic events or who suffer from mental or psychiatric disorders, and social interaction should be encouraged to reduce social isolation.

His song “i” heavily promotes self-improvement, as well as rejecting pessimism. He uses vivid imagery of gang violence both as a symbol of self-hatred and to discourage others against this lifestyle. The repetition of the phrase “I love myself” is an explicit reaffirmation of his message of self-love. Finally, his use of memory and allusions to other texts spread the sentiment of hope for youth in Compton to follow his footsteps in transcending the gang violence of Compton. Lamar uses symbolism to promote the idea of rejecting pessimism and promoting a positive self-image. His imagery of gang violence not only serves as a scathing critique of gang life but also serves as an allegory of a poor self-image. An overly critical internal monologue is like “a war outside and a bomb in the street/” and having “and a gun in the hood” to fight off “a mob of police.” He then utilizes hopeful imagery to show the listener that there is hope, both for those with depression and for Compton. “Dreams of reality's peace/ Blow steam in the face of the beast/ The sky could fall down, the wind could cry now/ The strong in me, I still smile,” he says. Using imagery and symbolism, Lamar promotes a message of self-improvement hope for Compton.Repetition is also used by Lamar to emphasize this message of a positive self-image in the face of adversity. The constant repetition of “I love myself” throughout his song emphasizes his escape from his violent background, as well as emphasizes his message of self-empowerment.

He romanticizes the wild and believes that it is untainted by the corruption of the modern world. The comparisons made in Into The Wild between Mccandless and others who died for a similar cause, all show that most have similar character traits. They often overly romanticize nature, idealising the discomfort and the suffering that it brings. Ruess’s letter to his friend symbolises this. “For two days ... I refuse to be driven out of the woods” McCandless’s romanticisation of Alaska is similar to the romanticisation that cost Ruess’s life. Both adventure seekers’s deaths can be put down to their romanticization of nature.With interviews with McCandless’s family, Jon Karakner paints a picture of Christofor Mccandless as a pensive, intelligent young man who has a history of defying authority. This is similar to other adventure seekers, such as Gene Rossalini, a gifted student and athlete who decided to conduct a unique anthropological experiment, by living in the wild like a primitive. While Rossellini killed himself, they are both extremely similar. Tired of society, McCandless heads into the wild to achieve emotional rebirth. Like Rossellini, McCandles comes to terms that he can't continue in the wild. While Rossellini kills himself, McCandless finds himself trapped in by rivers. Both die. Perhaps the greatest unifying factor among McCandless and those before him is the impulsiveness and overconfidence. Nick Jans’s letter summarizes this perfectly. “His ignorance … is what killed him” Like previous victims of Alaska, McCandless was hopelessly underprepared. Lacking a map or any way to contact anyone for help, it is no wonder that he died. Similar to Carl Mccunn, who entered the wild but forgot to arrange for a flight back, and Waterman, who tried to climb Denali but decided to go with almost no preparation. These adventure seekers, who just like McCandless went to Alaska to fulfill their alaskan fantasies, all died thanks to their lack of preparation. In conclusion, these adventurers all share a common trait. They overly romanticize nature, have an excessive desire for personal freedom, and wish to escape from the corruption of modern society. Perhaps they would find the words of MIT professor turned terrorist Ted Kaczynski to their liking. “The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.”",457,2413,0
human_51.txt,"In the short story To Build a Fire and the book Into the Wild, Nature is depicted as defeating the protagonists, a man and a dog. Throughout To build A Fire, the narrator speaks in third person, describing the various ways that nature conquers the protagonists. Both stories share similar themes, describing nature as heartless and uncaring. These two stores share similar lessons, including the need for preparation, and both share nature as the antagonist.First, both protagonist’s deaths could have been easily preventable. For example, the man in To Build a Fire decided to travel alone, against the advice of others. Among others, the Old Man at Sulphur Creek advised the man not to travel alone, as it was too cold this time of year. The protagonist ignores him and claims that he is unmanly. As a result, the protagonist freezes to death after falling through ice. Similar to this, Mccandless’s death could have been prevented if he had sought local help, as evidenced by his inability to preserve the moose. ““Maggots already! Smoking appears ineffective. Don’t know, looks like a disaster. I now wish I had never shot the moose. One of the greatest tragedies of my life.” (PAGE REFERENCE NUMBAAA) The man and Mccandless both died because of their hubris and lack of preparation, which also demonstrates that nature is uncaring. Mccandless and the Young Man are both killed by nature, as well as by their desires. The Young Man wanted to get to his camp by 6 oclock, which caused  him to rush and not pay attention. In his rush, he fell through ice, is unable to build a fire, and freezes to death. “He should not have built the fire under the pine tree. He should have built it in an open space. But it had been eas-ier to pull the sticks from the bushes and drop them directly on the fire.” Like the Young Man, Mccandless was also killed by his desires - specifically,his obsession to leave society behind. He chooses to leave behind the main trail, as well as decides to not bring a map. In addition, both people ventured into the wilderness for a similar reason: to experience what the wild has to offer. Thanks to their desires, both men die. This shows that nature lacks any form of compassion, further demonstrating that nature is the antagonist. Thirdly, Mcandless and the Young Man both enjoy being uncomfortable and suffering. Mccandless purposely went into the wild underprepared and without a backup plan, believing that he had adequate knowledge and the tools needed to survive. As a result, he dies. The man in To Build A Fire entered nature to challenge himself. He purposely goes alone, rejecting the advice of a much more experienced person, and without anyone to help him warm up, freezes to death. In their quest for a challenge, both men die. While both men accept their death, with Mccandless writing a peaceful journal entry and the man saying “You were right, old fellow. You were right.” This teaches the lesson that nature is dangerous, and preparation is required.                              In conclusion, Into The Wild and To Build a Fire both teach important lessons. The death of Mccandless and the unnamed man both teach the reader the importance of being prepared and	 not expecting that nature will recreate scenes from children's television shows. Nature killed both protagonists, so therefore it is the antagonist. ",601,2760,0
human_52.txt,"In the 1998 book Disgrace by J.M Coetzee, violence and oppression are common themes that are perpetrated by both the protagonist and the antagonists. Lurie and his daughter are attacked by 3 black men, who under aparthied-era South African policy,and therefore would have been oppressed. On the other side, however, Lurie oppresses the black minority when he hires a private detective agency to obtain private information on a prostitute. The lack of a clear line between the oppression of the protagonists and antagonists characterizes much of Disgrace. Lurie uses his authority as a professor and as a white man in Apartheid era South Africa to violate the privacy of a prostitute. Finding himself attracted to a prostitute, he hires a private detective to find her personal information. Coetzee writes: “Instead, he pays a detective agency to track her down. Within days he has her real name, her address, her telephone number.” (Chapter 1 p7) As the system of Apartheid was catered towards the white minority at the expense of the black majority, Lurie was able to hire a private detective without trouble, allowing him to oppress a black woman.Using his authority as a professor, Lurie is able to coerceMalaine into an inappropriate sexual relationship, which is a form of oppression. Malaine is unable to decline Lurie’s offer for a drink due to his role as an authority figure. “`I live just nearby. Can I invite you in for a drink?’” (Chapter 2 p11)  With his position as an authority figure, Lurie oppresses one of his students into an inappropriate sexual relationship. Violence is used by once-oppressed peoples to oppress their oppressors. Lurie is robbed, lit on fire, and his daughter is raped by three black youths. When one of the youths turns out to be Petrus’s cousin, Lurie’s daughter Lucy  is forced to marry Pollux. Petrus suggests:  “‘He will marry her,’ he says at last. ‘He will marry Lucy, only he is too young, too young to be marry. He is a child still.’” (chapter 22 p 179)  While Lucy doesn't want to marry, Petrus explains: ‘But here’, says Petrus, ‘it is dangerous, too dangerous. A woman must be marry.’ (chapter 22, p180) A member of the white minority is oppressed into marriage, by a man who sexually assaulted her, which is an ironic and tragic form of oppression.   In conclusion, violence and oppression are a major theme in Disgrace. The use of oppression on both sides by the protagonists and antagonists, creates a very blurred line.",423,2052,0
human_53.txt,"In Ernest Hemmingway’s book, The Old Man And The Sea, the main character Santiago is an unlucky fisherman. On the eighty fourth day of not catching any fish, he catches a massive marlin, which he struggles against  for three days before he catches it. Unfortunately, his catch is completely picked to the bone by sharks on his way back to port. While it looks like Santiago has been defeated, the reader is required to believe that Santibago has only been destroyed. Santiago doesn’t fit the definition of being defeated. According to Oxford Languages, one of the definitions of  defeated is “demoralized and overcome by adversity.” Santiago has always dreamed of lions on an african beach, symbolising his pride and love for fishing. “After that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the lions comedown onto it... he waited to see if there would be more lions and he was happy.” Even during and after his ordeal with the marlin, he still dreams about the pride of lions. This is significant because it indicates that his pride is unharmed by the ordeal, and he is therefore undefeatedSantiago’s body has been destroyed by his struggle with the marlin, but his spirit has not been defeated. In his conversation with Manolin after he has returned, he mentions the injuries that he has sustained. ““You get your hands well old man.” “I know how to care for them. In the night I spat something strange and felt something in my chest was broken.”“Get that well too,” the boy said.” While his body is greatly damaged, Santiago still has the will to continue fishing. In fact, it is in the same conversation where Santiago and Manolin are planning their next fishing trip. Along with showing how he refuses to be defeated, this also shows a level of stubbornness and will in Santiago, which was shown earlier in his struggle with the marlin. One major theme of The Old Man And The Sea is that a person can be destroyed but not defeated. In this respect, ‘destroyed’ refers to when an individual is physically damaged by an event, while defeated suggests mental withdrawal. The villagers' treatment of Santiago and his reaction is evidence of this. When he is labeled as “Saleo”, his eyes are still ”cheerful and undefeated.” Even during his struggle with the marlin, when his hands are being shredded by rope, his spirit remains undefeated. Lamenting the poor taste of raw fish and regretting his poor planning, he says: “I will never go in a boat again without salt or limes.” After his catch is stripped to the bone by sharks, he refuses to be defeated, and goes about planning his next trip with Manolin. Throughout the book the reader is reminded that Santiago is an example of how someone can be destroyed but not defeated. In conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence that Santiago has not been defeated. He is devastated by the ridicule of the other fisherman, while his body was damaged in his struggle with the merlin, and when his catch was stripped to the bone by sharks. He is physically destroyed, but still is undefeated, which is the ultimate thematic purpose of the novel.",543,2570,0
human_54.txt,"In the novel Into The Wild by Jon Karaker, Christopher, a deranged and misguided youth, seems to possess some qualities of a hero. Throughout his journey to his death, he leaves behind a positive impression on the people who he meets, as well as those who help him. To them, he is kind, smart, and brave. While these are qualities of a hero, thanks to his actions we know he is not one. His selfish and cruel actions towards his parents, and blatant disrespect for the land, prove that he is fallible at best.While Christopher is kind to the people who he meets on his journey, he is cruel and completely lacks compassion for his parents. He appears to be selfish, impulsive, and irrational. He impulsively donates his college fund and savings to Oxfam, selfishly cuts off contact with his parents, and irrationally decides to go on some sort of aesthetic pilgrimage to Alaska. He leaves without informing his parents, greatly worrying his father and mother. This is in stark contrast to the kind young man that the people who met Christopher saw. The suffering that he inflicts on his parents rules out any chance that he is a hero.Secondly, while he is judged to be smart by the people whom he meets, he lacks the ability to separate truth from fiction. His idealisation of Alaska and being the master of his own destiny all stem from the writings of Jack London, a drunkard who lived a sedentary lifestyle, and died at the age of 40. Many of his other heroes exhibited similar hypocrisy: “Tolstoy, despite his famous advocacy of celibacy, had been an enthusiastic sexual adventurer as young man and went on to father at least thirteen children, some of whom were conceived at the same time the censorious count was thundering in print against the evils of sex.” (85) If Christofer had actually looked into his literary heroes, he would have realised that perhaps his Alaska fantasy wasn't such a good idea. Thus, the basis of his ‘heroic philosophy’ is fundamentally flawed. In some ways, Christopher’s death reflects the hero's journey. He is transformed from a scholar with a pampered background, to a reinvented wanderer named “Alexander Supertramp'' who,  after a period of wandering around, sets off on a suicidally unprepared foray into an Alaskan provincial park. Nick Jans’s scathing letter about Mcandles perfectly summarizes what kind of “hero” he was. “I have no sympathy for him… screwing up because they lacked the requisite humility. It's a matter of degree.” (50) McCandles’s death is  accurately described as “simply one more dreamy half-cocked greenhorn who went into the country expecting to find answers to all his problems and instead found only mosquitoes and a lonely death.” Because of Mcandless’s death, society as a whole has benefitted from an effective cautionary tale about the dangers of fetishizing the “rough and rugged wilderness”.In conclusion, it is disrespectful to  call Christopher Mcandless a hero. In fact, he is best described with the handy visual aid that is provided at the bottom of this essay. At best, Mcandless can be described as an idealist, or as someone who couldn't accept that nature won’t suddenly become like an idealized version of a Disney princess movie. At worst, he is a bombastic narcissist who believed he could take on anything that nature could throw at him. Regardless, one shouldn’t view him as a hero. ",573,2800,0

gpt_1.txt,"Yossarian is the central character of Joseph Heller’s novel Catch-22. He is portrayed as a soldier who is unwilling to fight, and as a result, he tries to work his way out of the army through various means. Yossarian is depicted as a courageous man who is ultimately flawed by his inability to trust anyone, including himself. Through differing events throughout the novel and his interactions with the other characters, Yossarian grows and evolves.At the beginning of the book, Yossarian is simply trying to survive World War II. He is intelligent and understands that the epic war is not his fight. His refusal to fly additional missions is motivated by his eventual withdrawal from the war, and it leads him to become more suspicious of his comrades. He is condemned for being disruptive to others, and this leads to fractures in his relationships. He is willing to do whatever it takes to escape the military, but as his mission count grows, he begins to see the futility of it all.As the novel progresses, Yossarian gradually realizes the true horror and pointlessness of war. Yossarian becomes more disillusioned with the people around him, and the shadow of death hangs heavily over him. He begins to question everything around him; the army, the people, and the ability of people to do good. This inner turmoil leads to moments of madness and hatred, but ultimately also moments of surprising heroism.Yossarian's relationships with other characters are complicated. He is constantly at odds with his commanding officers and tends to see through their façade of honor and duty. He is distrustful of his peers, whom he suspects are faking their enthusiasm for battle, and he sees himself as a victim of their scheming. His relationships with women, particularly with Nurse Duckett and with the woman in Rome, embody his complicated nature.In the end, Yossarian finds a way to escape the military, but the price he pays is his own sense of honor and dignity. His experiences throughout the book have left him jaded, cynical, and distrustful of human nature. Yossarian is a uniquely human character who is deeply flawed, yet still a hero in his own way. The lessons we learn from his experiences are a testament to the complexity and difficulty of human existence and the struggle to find hope and meaning in a world that is often cruel and confusing.",397,1959,1

gpt_3.txt,"Arthur Miller's famous play, ""Death of a Salesman,"" centers around the character of Willy Loman, a struggling salesman nearing the end of his life. The play is also home to other central characters, who each play an essential role in the story. In this essay, I'll examine the motivations of four central characters of the play, particularly Willy Loman, Biff Loman, Happy Loman, and Linda Loman. I will determine if their motivations are linked or separate.To begin, Willy Loman's primary motivation is to provide for his family and give them a better life. As a salesman, he is determined to be successful and become a well-respected man in society. However, as he becomes older and his sales begin to decline, he begins to question the success he has achieved in his life. Willy's motivation is somewhat linked to Biff's, his eldest son. Biff was a popular football athlete in high school, and Willy believed that he had a bright future ahead of him. With his heart set on Biff becoming successful, Willy invests all his hope in his son, despite Biff's disinterest in the idea. When Biff abandons his goals and ambitions, Willy's motivation crumbles, and he becomes increasingly distraught.Biff Loman, on the other hand, has a different motivation for his life. Biff wants to disconnect from his father and begin a new life on his terms. Despite his father's high hopes for him, Biff feels like a failure because he never accomplished anything significant in his life. His motivation is to rid himself of his expectations and live a simple and honest life.Happy Loman's motivation is focused entirely on his success as a salesman. Unlike his brother, Happy does not wish to disengage himself from his father or take a life of his own. Happy is content with his job and is passionate about his success as a salesman, just like his father. He also views himself as a lady's man and is chasing after a married woman, which is a source of tension in the story.Lastly, Linda's motivation is to protect and support her family despite their constant hardships and struggles. Linda is the voice of reason in the play, who tries to keep the family together as they go through difficult times. Her primary motivation is to love and care for her family, which she does unconditionally.In conclusion, the four central characters of the play ""Death of a Salesman"" all have separate motivations. Willy Loman and Biff Loman's motivations are somewhat linked but differ in their desires for success. Happy Loman's motivation is entirely different from his family members, and he's more focused on his career. Linda Loman cares primarily about her family and ensuring that they stay together through their struggles. Understanding these characters' motivations is crucial in understanding the story's central conflict, which revolves around the American Dream, masculinity, and familial expectations.",477,2410,1

gpt_5.txt,"Draft 1:Fashion has always been an integral part of human culture as it serves as an effective way of self-expression. Interestingly, teenage years are often synonymous with fashion as young people embrace different clothing styles and trends, seeking to create their unique identity while fitting in with their peers. The importance of fashion to teenagers cannot be overstated as it impacts their self-esteem, confidence and helps in creating their self-identity. Fashion trends are caused due to various reasons, such as social media, celebrity endorsements, and historical movements. The following essay will delve deeper into why fashion is so important to teens and the causes and consequences of trends in fashion.Teenagers are at a period of personal development where they are trying to find their place in the world and create their identity. Fashion, as a form of self-expression, plays a crucial role in shaping their identity. Research shows that teenagers often use clothing to communicate their status, personality, and beliefs to others. They endeavor to find the perfect outfit that will allow them to stand out from the crowd while also fitting in with their peers. Furthermore, fashion creates a sense of belongingness for teenagers as they select clothing pieces that allow them to identify with a particular group of individuals sharing similar interests and styles. There are several causes of trends in fashion. Social media and its widespread use by teenagers considerably influence fashion trends. As a result, clothing trends spread faster than ever before through platforms like Instagram and Snapchat. Celebrity endorsements also play a significant role in the creation of fashion trends. Celebrities are influential figures, and their clothing styles often dictate fashion choices to a large extent. Historical movements also contribute to fashion trends, as seen in the goth and punk movements. The punk movement, for example, witnessed a significant rise in popularity as a form of rebellion against political and cultural norms.While fashion trends often bring about new and innovative clothing styles, their consequences should also be taken into account. The most apparent consequence of fashion trends is the pressure to keep up with the latest trends. Teenagers often feel like they have to follow these trends to fit in with their peers, thus putting pressure on their finances and self-esteem. Furthermore, fashion trends tend to be short-lived, leading to the purchase of clothing items that are not worn as frequently as they ought to be.In conclusion, fashion is a crucial part of a teenager's life as it helps them express their individuality, build self-esteem and forge their identity. The causes of fashion trends, such as social media and celebrity endorsements, have far-reaching consequences, influencing the way teenagers present themselves. The consequences of fashion trends, such as financial pressure and short-lived trends, should also be regarded when considering how fashion impacts teenagers. Ultimately, fashion and trends are significant aspects of teenage life that will continue to shape and influence generations to come.",487,2697,1
gpt_6.txt,"Life of Pi by Yann Martel is a story of a boy named Pi who is stranded at sea for 227 days with only a Bengal tiger for company. A key aspect of Pi's survival is his need for communication. To maintain his sanity and entertain himself, he journals his experience daily. Through his journaling, Pi conveys important lessons about the human need for communication.First, Pi's journal highlights the importance of communication for keeping track of time. Pi uses his journal to mark the days he has spent on the boat and to commemorate important events that happen. When he does not have a way to measure time, he feels lost and hopeless. This shows that humans need communication to establish a sense of order and control in their lives.Second, Pi's journal shows that communication is essential for processing emotions. In the beginning, he is scared, lonely, and homesick, but as he continues to journal, he gains a sense of peace and acceptance. He processes his emotions by exploring them in writing. Pi's journaling is a form of self-therapy, which allows him to process his experiences and emotions.Third, Pi's journaling highlights the need for connection with others. Writing in his journal allows him to communicate with people he has left behind. He writes letters to his family and imagines their replies. This shows that human beings need communication to maintain relationships. Even when we are physically alone, we still seek interaction and connection.Fourth, Pi's journaling conveys important themes about the human need for creativity and expression. Through his writing, Pi invents stories, poems, and even songs. He also uses creative thinking to solve problems and invent new ways to survive. This demonstrates that communication is not only essential for survival but also for personal growth and development.Finally, Pi's journal highlights the importance of language and its ability to unify and connect people from different backgrounds. Pi speaks fluently and comfortably in three languages - English, French, and Tamil. He uses this ability to communicate with his animals, and this helps him connect with his surroundings. His language skills also reveal the universality and interconnectedness of human cultures.In conclusion, Pi's journaling in Life of Pi reveals the importance of communication for basic survival as well as personal growth, relationship building, and developing a sense of identity. His constant need for communication shows that humans are inherently social beings and that we thrive on connectivity. By sharing his personal experience with journaling, Pi reminds us that communication is a fundamental aspect of humanity, without which, we would struggle to survive.",428,2288,1
gpt_7.txt,"Suicide is a tragic phenomenon that has been known to affect all age groups, but it is particularly distressing when it affects teenagers. There are a variety of causes of suicide among teenagers, but some of the most common ones are depression, substance abuse, peer pressure and bullying, unstable home environments, and stress. First, depression is a common cause of suicide amongst teenagers. Depression is a persistent feeling of sadness and hopelessness, and it can lead to thoughts of suicide. Second, substance abuse is another leading cause of suicide among teenagers. This is because substances such as drugs and alcohol can lead to impaired judgment and cause teenagers to behave impulsively. Third, peer pressure and bullying are also major causes of suicide among teenagers. Peer pressure can lead teenagers down a path of self-destruction, while bullying can destroy their self-esteem and leave them feeling worthless. Fourth, unstable home environments are another leading cause of suicide amongst teenagers. Conflict between family members, as well as neglect or abuse, can all contribute to a teenager's heightened feelings of insecurity and hopelessness. Finally, stress is also a contributor to teenage suicide. Teenagers face a lot of pressure from school, their peers, and their families. If they don't have the resources to handle this pressure, they may turn to suicide as a way out.While it is true that suicide amongst teenagers remains a significant problem, there are things that can be done to avert this trend. First, it is important to raise awareness about the warning signs of suicide amongst teenagers. It is crucial for family, teachers, and friends to look out for signs of suicidal behavior, such as changes in sleep patterns and appearance, the loss of interest in once-enjoyable activities, and withdrawal from social situations. Second, it is imperative to address the root causes of suicidal behavior among teenagers. This may mean providing counseling services to help teenagers struggling with depression, substance abuse, or stress. Additionally, schools and communities must work together to tackle bullying and peer pressure, by teaching children about the importance of respect and empathy. Finally, it is imperative that parents create a stable and supportive home environment for their children, by actively listening to their concerns, offering guidance and being involved in their lives.In conclusion, teenage suicide is a major concern that requires attention and action. The most common causes of the suicide among teenagers are depression, substance abuse, peer pressure and bullying, unstable home environments, and stress. To avert this trend, society must raise awareness about the warning signs of suicide, address the root causes of suicidal behavior, provide counseling services, and create a stable and supportive home environment.

gpt_9.txt,"In his Ted Talk entitled ‘What Really Matters at the end of life,’ BJ Miller uses his own personal experience to inform his point of view regarding this question. As a triple amputee and as the former Executive Director of the Zen Hospice Project, Miller has witnessed and lived through some of the most difficult experiences that a human can undergo. Through his anecdotes and stories, as well as his philosophical musings, Miller presents a vision of life and death that is both profound and challenging.One way in which Miller uses his own experience to inform his point of view is through his discussion of pain and suffering. Having undergone severe physical trauma as a result of a tragic accident while he was in college, Miller has a unique understanding of what it means to live with pain and suffering. This experience has given him a deep sense of empathy towards others who are facing similar challenges. As a hospice worker, he has spent countless hours helping patients and their families deal with pain and suffering at the end of life. Through his work and his own lived experience, Miller has come to the conclusion that pain is an inevitable part of life and that there is no escaping it. However, he argues that we can learn to live with pain and even find meaning in it.Another way in which Miller uses his own experience to inform his point of view is through his discussion of the role of palliative care at the end of life. Palliative care is the medical specialty that focuses on providing relief from the symptoms and stress of serious illness. As someone who has undergone a great deal of medical treatment over the course of his life, Miller has a deep understanding of the ways in which palliative care can make a difference. He argues that palliative care is not just about relieving pain, but about helping patients and their families find meaning and purpose in their lives, even in the face of great suffering.Finally, Miller uses his own experience to inform his point of view by challenging us to think about what really matters in life. As someone who has faced his own mortality on multiple occasions, Miller has a unique perspective on what is truly important in life. He argues that we need to shift our focus away from material things and towards meaningful relationships and experiences. By doing so, we can live a life that is full and rich, even in the face of adversity.In conclusion, BJ Miller’s personal experiences as a triple amputee and as a hospice worker inform his point of view on what really matters at the end of life. Through his anecdotes and stories, as well as his philosophical musings, Miller challenges us to rethink our attitudes towards pain and suffering, palliative care, and the meaning of life itself. While his ideas may be difficult to accept, they are nonetheless thought-provoking and worthy of our attention and consideration.",500,2399,1
gpt_10.txt,"Garrett Hardin's article, ""Lifeboat Ethics: the Case Against Helping the Poor,"" presents a controversial perspective on the issue of poverty and the ethical considerations involved in offering aid to those in need. He argues that the world is comparable to a lifeboat, and that there is limited capacity for resources. Therefore, people should prioritize their own survival and well-being and refrain from helping the poor. This essay seeks to explore the justifications and evidence used by Hardin to support his point and assess the efficacy of his argument.According to Hardin, individuals and nations are reaching a point where resources are limited. He uses the metaphor of a lifeboat to illustrate this point effectively. The lifeboat represents the world's resources, and those on the boat represent the wealthy countries, while the people in the water are the poor nations. The argument suggests that there are limited resources on the lifeboat, and, if help is given to people in the water, it will lead to overburdening the lifeboat and eventually causing it to capsize. Therefore, he believes that it is in everybody's best interest to focus on maintaining one's survival rather than helping others.Hardin justifies his arguments by using examples to illustrate the points he makes concerning the existence of limited resources. He cites examples of past aid efforts like the World Food Bank, which only exacerbated the problem and promoted unsustainable growth in the recipient countries, which made the situation worse in the long run. Hardin also claims that the population of countries must be controlled, and welfare provision must be cut back to prevent the growth of the population in the first place. In essence, Hardin's arguments are based on the belief that there is no ideal solution to poverty, and such efforts often lead to squandering of resources and widespread harm.Hardin's arguments are, however, based on a few flawed assumptions. Firstly, he assumes that the lifeboat's occupants do not have the capacity to help the people in the water. However, many wealthy nations do have the resources and means to offer effective aid. Secondly, Hardin's arguments fail to account for the links between poverty and inequality and the ways in which the failure to help people who are suffering can contribute to both. Helping the poor can ultimately benefit the entire world by reducing poverty and creating a more sustainable future.In conclusion, Hardin's arguments against aiding the poor are based on the concept of limited resources. While his argument appears compelling at first sight, it fails to account for the ways in which aid can help break the cycle of poverty and establish a more equitable society. Through the provision of aid and resources, we can reduce inequality and contribute to a more sustainable future, rather than ignore the struggles of millions of people solely to prioritize individual and national interests.",472,2488,1
gpt_11.txt,"Joseph Heller’s novel Catch-22 is a masterpiece of satirical fiction that exposes the absurdity of war. It follows the experiences of Captain John Yossarian, an Air Force pilot, who is desperate to avoid fighting in World War II and desperate to get out of the military. One of the most intriguing symbols in the novel is the Catch-22 itself. Its presence pervades the entire story, serving as a critique of the military and the absurdity of the war. In this essay, I will analyze the importance of the Catch-22 as a symbol in the novel.The Catch-22 is a paradoxical situation in which it is impossible to escape a certain predicament, regardless of the actions taken. The irony inherent in the Catch-22 is that it is presented as a way for the military to protect its soldiers, but in reality, it is a way for the military to keep them trapped and unable to escape their dangerous and potentially fatal circumstances. It becomes clear as the novel progresses that the Catch-22 is a tool used by those in power to maintain control. This symbol highlights the bureaucratic absurdity of the military and the circular reasoning that underpins it.The Catch-22 has a significant impact on the character of Yossarian, who becomes fixated on the concept as he recognizes that it is used to force him to continue flying dangerous missions even after he has reached his quota. Yossarian’s attempts to escape the Catch-22 only lead to more trouble and confusion, as the bureaucracy behind the rule cannot be deciphered. He becomes increasingly disillusioned by the endless bureaucracy and inability to escape the war, ultimately questioning the values of the military and the nature of the war itself. The Catch-22 serves as a symbol of the unraveling of the logic behind war and the futility of trying to escape its grip.In addition, the Catch-22 reflects a broader social critique of the post-war era. During this time, systems of power, such as the government, military, and corporations, began to be questioned and viewed with suspicion. Many felt that these institutions had become oppressive and impossible to escape. The Catch-22, as a symbol, serves to capture this zeitgeist and express this critique. It highlights the bureaucratic absurdity of the systems of power and their inherent contradictions.Ultimately, the Catch-22 is a symbol that underscores the absurdity of war and the human condition. It shows the futility of trying to escape danger and death, and the inherent contradictions of systems of power. The Catch-22 forces readers to reflect on the moral complexity and the destructive impact of war, while highlighting the importance of questioning systems of power and their underlying principles. It is clear that the presence of this symbol serves to elevate Catch-22 beyond a simple story of war and into a powerful critique of human nature itself.",472,2392,1
gpt_12.txt,"Albert Camus’s The Stranger is a literary masterpiece that has captivated both readers and critics since its publication. The story chronicles the life of the protagonist, Meursault, who, after committing a seemingly inexplicable murder, is put on trial and sentenced to death. While awaiting execution, Meursault experiences a profound ‘revelation.’ However, the authenticity of this epiphany has been a topic of debate among scholars and readers. In this essay, I will argue that Meursault’s revelation is genuine and is not just a result of his fear over his impending death.Firstly, it is essential to understand Meursault’s character and personality to comprehend the authenticity of his transformation. Meursault is a man who seems to be detached from the world around him – a man who is indifferent to his mother’s death and is indifferent to the fact that he killed a man. However, his indifference is not rooted in evil, but in his desire for authenticity and honesty. Thus, when Meursault experiences his ‘revelation,’ it is not because he is afraid to die, but because he has finally accepted the truth about the world and his place in it.Secondly, Meursault’s revelation is evident in the way he begins to perceive the world around him. Before his epiphany, Meursault is a man who is indifferent to life – he does not have any aspirations or desires. However, after his transformation, Meursault appreciates even the simplest things in life, such as the smell of coffee, the warmth of the sun, and the sound of laughter. This transformation is not something that is forced but is an organic change that occurs within Meursault.Thirdly, the authenticity of Meursault’s revelation is evident in the way he reacts to his impending execution. Meursault is not a man who fears death, nor is he a man who denies its inevitability. On the contrary, he accepts his fate with open arms and finds comfort in the fact that he will no longer have to live a life without meaning. This reaction shows that Meursault’s transformation is genuine and is not just a reaction to his fear of dying.Moreover, Meursault’s revelation is an integral part of Camus’s philosophy of existentialism. Camus believed that the world was inherently meaningless and that individuals had to find their meaning in this meaningless existence. Meursault is the embodiment of Camus’s philosophy, and his revelation is an acceptance of this philosophy. Therefore, Meursault’s transformation is not just a result of his fear over his impending death but is an acceptance of his place in the world.In conclusion, Meursault’s transformation in Camus’s The Stranger is authentic and is not just a reaction to his fear of dying. Meursault’s transformation is rooted in his desire for authenticity and honesty and is evident in the way he perceives the world around him. Additionally, Meursault’s acceptance of his impending execution confirms the authenticity of his transformation. Furthermore, Meursault’s transformation is an essential part of Camus’s philosophy of existentialism and is, therefore, an acceptance of his place in the world.",500,2612,1
gpt_13.txt,"The cultivation, consumption, cultural usage, and trade of spirits and coffee have had a significant impact on the development of human society. These fundamental beverages have played an integral role in shaping societies by offering a variety of contributions from cultural to economic significance.To begin with, the cultivation of spirits and coffee has boosted the economy of many countries. The trade of coffee and spirits has been a source of livelihood for many individuals globally. This trade has led to the growth of economies, created job opportunities for many people, and improved the living standards of those in the coffee-producing regions. Coffee, for instance, is one of the most traded commodities globally and has played a significant role in the economy of many countries such as Brazil and Ethiopia.Furthermore, the consumption of coffee and spirits has become crucial to the cultural identity of many societies. Coffee has been integrated into the daily routine of many people worldwide, and its consumption is often associated with social interactions and relaxation. In many Middle Eastern countries such as Turkey, coffee drinking is considered a cultural ceremony, and it is considered insulting not to offer coffee to visitors.

For example, coffee houses in Europe were hotspots for intellectuals and artists who would gather to discuss politics, poetry, music, and social issues. Similarly, bars and clubs are often significant sources of cultural entertainment, particularly in urban settings, where they host diverse and vibrant events.In conclusion, it is evident that spirits and coffee have played a significant role in shaping human society.

These social beverages have influenced the evolution of human culture, technological advancements, and economic trade. From ancient times to modern-day society, the consumption of beer and wine has had a profound impact on human society.The cultivation of wine and beer dates back to ancient civilizations such as the Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians. The production of these beverages played an important role in cultural and social practices of these societies. Wine was often used in religious ceremonies and seen as a way to connect with the divine. Beer was used as a form of payment, and its production was a significant source of employment. The cultivation of grapes and barley led to the development of irrigation systems, which improved agricultural techniques and increased food production.The consumption of beer and wine has also impacted the development of human society. Drinking these beverages was a way for people to socialize and connect with one another. Toasting, the act of raising a glass in celebration, is a common social practice that originated from the consumption of beer and wine. Additionally, drinking alcohol has been linked to artistic expression, with many famous writers and artists such as Ernest Hemingway and Vincent van Gogh relying on alcohol as a source of inspiration.The trade of beer and wine has played a significant role in the global economy. During the Middle Ages, the production and trade of wine fueled the growth of cities such as Bordeaux and Tuscany. This economic trade led to the development of new technologies such as the wine press and improved transportation methods, such as the introduction of the horse and carriage. The production and trade of beer have also had a significant impact on modern economies, with breweries and microbreweries serving as a source of employment and income in many regions of the world.In conclusion, the cultivation, consumption, and trade of beer and wine have had a profound impact on the development of human society. From the development of agricultural and irrigation techniques to the growth of economies, the influence of these social beverages can be seen throughout history.

gpt_15.txt,"Orwell's essay ""Shooting an Elephant"" reveals not just his personal conflict with shooting an elephant but also his criticism of the British colonial system and its political authority in Burma. The metaphorical vehicle of the elephant offers Orwell an opportunity to present his case against British colonialism. By portraying himself as the protagonist and his audience as witnesses, Orwell demonstrates the consequences of imperialism and the collision between the colonizers and the colonized.Orwell's first paragraph in ""Shooting an Elephant"" provides the background of the story. He describes the role of being a British police officer and implies that his job is to maintain law and order in Burma, part of the British Empire. The opening lines, “In Moulmein, in Lower Burma, I was hated by large numbers of people,” reveal the complexity of the situation. Orwell realizes that he is unpopular among the Burmese, and the following paragraphs highlight how the Burmese have already made him feel conflicted.Furthermore, the metaphorical vehicle of the elephant is a representation of the British Empire in Burma. Orwell writes that the “beast” was ""peaceful"" until it was disturbed. The elephant's madness represents British imperialism in Burma. Just as the elephant goes mad when it is provoked, so does the British Empire when it wants to show its power. Orwell is compelled to shoot the elephant because he knows the colonized expect him to do so. Moreover, the elephant's death symbolizes the murder of the Burmese and the Burmese nation's loss.By the end of the essay, the elephant's metaphor evolves from a symbol of British imperialism to a symbol of the trapped Orwell. His hatred for imperialism overflows into self-hatred, and the terrible qualities of the colonizers intertwine with his moral dilemma. It is evident that Orwell is no different from the colonizers but is a participant in this system. Still, he has enough self-awareness to realize he is not an autonomous agent in Burma. He is trapped within the political authority and structures imposed upon him by his countrymen.Ultimately, Orwell's essay is a critique of British colonialism and imperialism. Orwell's personal dilemma with shooting the elephant represents the conflicts and ethical dilemmas commonly faced by the British Empire officials in Burma. The novel has a powerful imagery that makes readers realize that the actions of the colonizers have dehumanizing effects on both sides of the imperialist exchange. In conclusion, the metaphorical vehicle of the elephant allows Orwell to present his argument against British colonialism and political authority in Burma.",415,2243,1
gpt_17.txt,"The idea of free college tuition is a topic that has been increasingly discussed in recent years. Higher education institutions have become more and more expensive, putting a significant financial burden on students and their families. In this essay, I will argue why college should be free.Firstly, free college will create equal opportunities for all students. Currently, the cost of education is a significant obstacle for students from low-income families, who may not be able to afford higher education, despite their academic abilities. Without access to higher education, it is harder for students to pursue their desired careers and access better-paying jobs. By making college free, we can level the playing field, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their financial background, has the same opportunity to access higher education and a brighter future.Secondly, free college will increase the overall education level of society. With easier access to higher education, more people will be able to pursue their education dreams, becoming more knowledgeable and skilled. Such a scenario will lead to a more productive society and more robust economic growth in the long term. The higher the level of education in a society, the more economically stable it becomes, enabling it to create more jobs, bring more technology advancements, and solve many economic and social challenges.Thirdly, free college will reduce student debt. Currently, a significant number of students cannot afford to pay for their tuition, and thus, must take out student loans, which can take many years to pay off. Such debts can affect students' future financial stability since it can impact their ability to qualify for mortgages, car loans, and other kinds of loans. By making college free, students will no longer need to take on massive debts, giving them an opportunity to invest in other areas of their future.Furthermore, free college will give students more flexibility in career choices. In many cases, students must choose their courses based on how much they can afford, which can limit their career options. With free college, students can pursue courses that align with their interests and passions, providing them with more career options and enabling them to make bigger contributions in their chosen fields.Finally, free college will benefit the larger community. Highly educated students can use their knowledge and skills to solve societal challenges and improve their communities. By providing students with access to free quality education, we can produce a generation of skilled workers who are well-equipped to create tangible positive change both locally and globally.In conclusion, to realize a brighter future where opportunities can be availed of equal footing, and students are not burdened with student loans, we must embrace free college education. By enabling students to pursue their dreams, reducing student debt, and enabling the economy to thrive, free college has significant benefits that go beyond the individual student. With free college education, we can ensure a more educated, productive, and prosperous future for everyone.",485,2668,1
gpt_16.txt,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a classic novel that explores the lives of patients in a mental institution. However, the book has faced criticism for its treatment of race and gender. Many argue that the book reinforces negative attitudes towards women and minorities. This essay will explore why this is the case.To start with, the book has been criticized for its treatment of women. The character of Nurse Ratched is often perceived as a symbol of the oppressive nature of the female gender. She can be seen as a representation of the stereotype that women are cold, manipulative, and controlling. Additionally, the character of Candy is portrayed as a sex object and is only valued for her beauty. This representation reinforces harmful gender stereotypes.Moreover, the book has been criticized for its portrayal of minorities. The character of the Chief is a Native American who is presented as a stereotypical ""silent Indian."" The novel implies that he is considered ""primitive"" and ""uncivilized."" Furthermore, the other African American characters in the book are portrayed as thugs and criminals. These portrayals rely on negative racial stereotypes that are harmful and perpetuate systemic racism.Furthermore, the novel has been criticized for the lack of agency given to the female characters. There is a distinct lack of female characters with agency, and those that exist are often seen as subordinate to male characters. Additionally, the novel presents an environment that is hostile to women. It shows a world where women are seen as inferior and must submit to the authority of men.In conclusion, while One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a thought-provoking novel, it does suffer from issues with its portrayal of gender and race. The negative representation of women and minorities reinforces harmful stereotypes, and the lack of agency given to female characters is concerning. However, these issues do not detract from the overall message of the novel, which is the importance of individual freedom and questioning authority. Nonetheless, it is important to acknowledge and address the problematic aspects of the novel when engaging with it.",344,1821,1
gpt_18.txt,"The Corrections by Jonathan Franzen is a novel that delves deep into the intricacies of family life. The novel spans half a century, and through its characters, it explores the changes that have taken place in the world and in family life during that time. While the Lambert family may not be representative of all American families, there are certainly elements of their experiences that are universal.One of the central themes of The Corrections is the breakdown of the traditional nuclear family. The Lamberts are a family that is falling apart at the seams, with each member struggling to find their place in the world. Alfred, the patriarch of the family, is suffering from Parkinson's disease and is slowly losing his ability to control his body and mind. Enid, his wife, is desperate to hold the family together and ignores her own needs in the process. The children, Gary, Chip, and Denise, are all struggling to find their place in the world and are unable to communicate with each other effectively.In many ways, the Lambert family reflects the changes that have taken place in American family life over the past fifty years. The traditional nuclear family is no longer the norm, and families are becoming more diverse in terms of structure and composition. Divorce rates are higher, and families are more likely to be headed by single parents or same-sex couples.Despite the changes that have taken place, there are certainly aspects of family life that remain the same. The Lamberts' struggles with communication, for example, are a universal experience. Many families struggle to communicate effectively, and this can lead to misunderstandings, conflict, and resentment.The world in general has changed a great deal over the past fifty years, and The Corrections reflects many of these changes. The advent of the internet and social media has radically transformed the way we communicate and interact with each other. The rise of globalism has led to increased cultural exchange and diversity. At the same time, the novel highlights the challenges and drawbacks of these changes, such as the loss of privacy and the increasing pressure to conform to societal norms.In terms of family life, there are certainly aspects that are better now than when the Lambert children were young. For example, there is more awareness and acceptance of mental health issues and the need for open communication about them. On the other hand, there are also new challenges that families face, such as the pressure to conform to unrealistic standards of success and the increased stress and pressure that come with modern life.In conclusion, The Corrections by Jonathan Franzen offers a nuanced and complex exploration of family life, both past and present. While the experiences of the Lambert family may not be universal, they certainly reflect many of the changes and challenges that American families have faced over the past fifty years. Through its characters and their struggles, the novel offers a deep and insightful reflection on the complexities of modern family life.",499,2574,1
gpt_19.txt,"In David Mitchell’s novel Cloud Atlas, the last lines of the novel, “My life amounts to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean. Yet what is any ocean, but a multitude of drops?” are significant in understanding the overall message of the novel. These lines speak to the interconnectedness of all things and the power of individual actions to make a collective impact.Throughout the novel, Mitchell weaves together six distinct narratives across different time periods and locations. Each narrative is linked to the others through their themes and characters, showing the ways in which individual actions can have ripple effects across generations and even centuries. The novel’s structure and themes reflect the idea that every individual’s story is just one drop in the greater ocean of human history.The novel’s main message is that individual actions matter and can have far-reaching consequences. This is seen in several of the novel’s narratives, including that of Luisa Rey, a journalist in the 1970s who uncovers a conspiracy involving a nuclear power plant. Her investigation leads to the exposure of corruption and the prevention of a catastrophic disaster. Similarly, in the narrative of Sonmi-451, a fabricant (a type of genetically-engineered clone) in a dystopian future who becomes self-aware and leads a rebellion against her oppressors, her individual actions spark a larger movement for freedom.The last lines of the novel are indicative of this message. The first sentence, “My life amounts to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean,” acknowledges the insignificance of any one individual in the grand scheme of things. However, the second sentence, “Yet what is any ocean, but a multitude of drops?” highlights the importance of individual actions in creating something larger. Though each person’s impact may seem small on its own, together they can create something greater than the sum of their parts.Overall, the last lines of Cloud Atlas serve as a powerful reminder that every individual action matters, no matter how small it may seem. It offers a hopeful message that even the most seemingly insignificant person can have a powerful impact when their actions are combined with those of others. This is a message that is particularly relevant in today’s world, where many people feel powerless in the face of large-scale global challenges. The novel encourages readers to take action in their own spheres of influence, knowing that even the smallest actions can contribute to a greater, positive outcome.",405,2134,1
gpt_20.txt,"Joseph Heller’s Catch-22 is a masterpiece of satire that lampoons the absurdity of war by using a variety of rhetorical devices, including paradoxes and other logical fallacies. In this essay, I will explore how these devices are used to expose the irrationality of war and the duplicitous nature of those in power.At the heart of Catch-22 is the titular paradox, which states that one can only be excused from flying dangerous missions if one is declared insane, but to ask to be excused from the missions is evidence of sanity and therefore condemns one to fly them. This paradox highlights the Catch-22 situation faced by soldiers in war – they are trapped in a system that seems designed to destroy them, and even attempts to escape it lead only to further entrapment. By exposing this absurdity, Heller is able to challenge the conventional wisdom that war is a necessary evil and instead show it to be a self-perpetuating cycle of folly.In addition to the Catch-22 paradox, Heller also uses a range of other logical fallacies to satirize the war effort. Perhaps the most notable is the circular logic used by the military to justify their actions. For example, when a village is bombed and innocent civilians are killed, the response is that they must have been guilty of something – after all, why else would they be in such a strategic location? Similarly, the military insists that everything is going according to plan, even when it clearly isn’t, and refuses to acknowledge any failures or setbacks.Overall, the point of using these logical fallacies is to show how ridiculous it is to try and rationalize something as fundamentally irrational as war. By exposing the flawed thinking of those in charge, Heller is able to undermine their authority and show the futility of their efforts.Another key element of satirizing the absurdity of war is to use humor, and Catch-22 certainly does this with relish. From the absurd characters – such as Milo Minderbinder, who runs a black market empire on the side – to the ridiculous situations – like the ongoing battle to get enough silk for the parachutes – Heller employs a wide range of comic devices to get his point across. Importantly, however, this humor is never used to undermine the seriousness of war itself; rather, it serves as a means of highlighting just how farcical the whole endeavor can be.Ultimately, the goal of Catch-22 is not simply to ridicule war or those who fight it. Instead, it seeks to expose the fundamental flaws in the logic that leads to war in the first place. By showing how logic can be twisted and distorted to justify even the most heinous of actions, Heller aims to challenge our preconceptions and encourage us to think more critically about the choices we make.In conclusion, Catch-22 is an incisive and witty satire that uses a range of rhetorical devices to expose the absurdity of war and those who engage in it. The use of paradoxes and other logical fallacies serves to highlight the inherent irrationality of war, while the humor and wit of the novel keep the reader engaged throughout. Ultimately, it is a powerful indictment of the lengths to which people will go to justify their actions, and a call for greater critical engagement in the face of such madness.",557,2708,1
gpt_21.txt,"In James Joyce's ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,"" the protagonist, Stephen Dedalus, is heavily influenced by his Irish nationality and what it means to be Irish. Stephen experiences conflicting feelings about his nationality and struggles to come to terms with his place in Irish society. Throughout the novel, Stephen rebels against the limitations of being Irish and tries to establish his own identity.Firstly, Stephen is deeply influenced by the religious and political atmosphere of Ireland. His Catholic upbringing and Irish nationalist sentiment form the backdrop of his childhood. Stephen is exposed to the ongoing conflicts and struggles of the Irish people and feels a sense of pride and responsibility for his country. However, Stephen quickly realizes the limitations and contradictions of Irish society. The politics, religion and social norms are all in direct conflict with his individuality and creativity, making him feel misplaced within his own culture.Secondly, Stephen is conflicted about his Irish identity. On one hand, he feels a deep love and admiration for his homeland and its people. On the other hand, he feels constrained and repressed by the confines of Irish culture. Stephen often feels trapped by the narrow-mindedness and conformity of Irish society, leaving him feeling out of place. Stephen has great aspirations for his artistic life, but the conservative, provincial community that surrounds him does not allow him the freedom to thrive and create. Finally, Stephen ultimately rebels against his Irish identity altogether. He feels oppressed by the cultural, political, and social norms of his country and decides to renounce his nationalism entirely. He feels so constrained and held under such restrictions that he breaks free and leaves Ireland to pursue his artistic interests in Europe. Stephen hopes that by leaving Ireland, he can escape the restrictions that have hindered his creative growth as an artist. In conclusion, the Irish identity is an essential part of Stephen's character, which profoundly affects him throughout the novel. Stephen's struggle with his Irish identity is a recurring theme in the book. He experiences a love for his country but also recognizes the limitations and restraints placed upon him as an Irishman. Ultimately, Stephen's rebellion against his Irish nationality is his way of expressing his need for creative expression and a desire to be free of social constraints. Stephen's rebellion against the Irish identity is an essential aspect of his personal growth and journey towards self-discovery.",401,2187,1

In these speeches, the two characters set out to persuade the crowd to their respective views. The purpose of this essay is to compare and contrast the two speeches, to determine how each character aimed to sway the crowd, and to analyze the impact their speeches had on future events.Brutus delivers his speech first. His intention is to show the crowd that he did not kill Caesar out of jealousy or ambition but for the good of the people. Brutus’ strategy involves appealing to the audience’s rationality by explaining how Caesar was a tyrant. He speaks calmly, using simple language so that the ordinary people of Rome can understand him. Brutus’ speech is based on reason and logic and is designed to appeal to the audience’s sense of duty and patriotism. He achieves this by continuously using the word “honourable” to describe his actions, and clearly stating that he had no personal motive to kill Caesar.Antony's strategy is different. He aims to turn the audience against Brutus and the other conspirators, and to avenge Caesar. He plays on the emotions of the crowd by using irony and sarcasm to undermine Brutus’ credibility. Anthony's speech is more inflammatory than Brutus’, making direct accusations of murder and branding Brutus a deceiver. By using repetitive rhetorical questions (""But Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honourable man;""), he creates an atmosphere that leads the audience to conclude that Brutus is not, in fact, honourable.Antony's speech is successful in swaying the crowd to his side, and he is able to incite a riot that turns on Brutus and the conspirators. He has managed to turn public opinion towards Caesar and, by extension, towards himself. Antony’s speech exposes the weaknesses in Brutus’ argument and succeeds in showing him as someone who lacks credibility. The crowd is roused into action, and the conspirators are forced to flee Rome.The impact of the speeches on future events is significant. Brutus’ speech is designed to suggest that he acted in the best interests of Rome, but it is also designed to set out his agenda for the future. Antony, on the other hand, seeks revenge and wants to restore the old order that Caesar put in place. By winning the hearts and minds of the people, Antony is able to consolidate his power and become the dominant force in Roman politics. He is able to take revenge on those who opposed him and continue with Caesar's legacy. Brutus, meanwhile, is forced to flee Rome and eventually takes his own life. To conclude, both Brutus and Antony have different aims and strategies in their speeches in Julius Caesar. Brutus' speech aimed to rationalize his action and provide a logical basis for the audience to accept his motives. Antony's speech, however, delivered an emotional and inflammatory argument to sway the crowd. By depicting Brutus as a deceiver, and painting Caesar as a victim, Antony's speech was ultimately the most successful in terms of weakening the conspirators' grip on power, and consolidating his own position. The consequences of these speeches are far-reaching, and set the tone for the remainder of the play.",564,2795,1
gpt_23.txt,"Throughout Julius Caesar, Shakespeare presents a complex portrait of the relationship between omens and fate. On the one hand, the characters in the play often believe that their destiny is predetermined by the gods. On the other hand, the play also suggests that individuals can exercise free will and make choices that affect their fate. Ultimately, Shakespeare's portrayal of omens and fate in Julius Caesar can be seen as a commentary on the nature of power and the role that human agency plays in determining the course of history.In the play, omens are an important source of information about the future. Characters like the soothsayer and the augurers use the behavior of animals and the movement of celestial bodies to make predictions about events that have not yet come to pass. For example, the appearance of a comet over Rome is seen as a sign of political upheaval, while the sacrifice of a bull indicates that Caesar will be victorious in battle. These omens lend an air of inevitability to the events of the play, suggesting that the characters are simply pawns in a larger cosmic game.At the same time, however, the play also presents characters who exercise agency and make conscious choices that affect their fate. For example, Brutus decides to join the conspiracy against Caesar even though it goes against his personal principles. This decision ultimately leads to his downfall, but it is also a reflection of his own agency as a character. Similarly, Antony's decision to deliver a funeral oration for Caesar is a conscious choice that affects the direction of the play. These moments of agency suggest that the characters in the play are not simply victims of the fates but have some degree of control over their own destiny.Despite these opportunities for agency, however, the play ultimately suggests that the forces of fate are too powerful to be overcome. This is perhaps best exemplified by the recurring motif of blood in the play, which serves as a reminder of the inevitability of violence and death. Even characters who exercise their own agency are ultimately unable to escape their fates. For example, Brutus commits suicide rather than being captured, but his death is still part of a larger pattern of violence that seems to be dictated by fate rather than personal choice.Ultimately, Shakespeare's portrayal of omens and fate in Julius Caesar is a complex one that resists easy interpretation. While the play suggests that characters have some degree of agency over their own fate, it also emphasizes the overwhelming power of fate and the ways in which characters are ultimately unable to escape their destiny. This tension between agency and fate is reflective of the broader theme of power that runs throughout the play, suggesting that even the most powerful individuals are subject to forces beyond their control.",472,2385,1
gpt_24.txt,"The meeting between Cassius and Brutus in Act 1, Scene 2 of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar is one of the most significant moments of the play. It marks the beginning of the conspiracy against Caesar and sets the stage for the rest of the drama. Cassius uses cunning tactics to convince Brutus to join him and the other conspirators, and his success is a testament to his powers of persuasion.The first thing to note about the meeting between Cassius and Brutus is the sense of tension and unease that surrounds both characters. Brutus is deeply troubled by Caesar’s rise to power and the potential threat he poses to Rome. Cassius, meanwhile, is driven by his own personal animosity towards Caesar and his desire for revenge. Both men are searching for a way to rid Rome of Caesar’s tyranny, and their shared sense of purpose is what ultimately brings them together.Cassius, however, is the one who takes the initiative and sets the plan in motion. He begins by appealing to Brutus’s sense of honor and duty to Rome. He reminds Brutus of his noble heritage and his reputation as a man of integrity and principle. In doing so, Cassius seeks to create a sense of obligation in Brutus, a feeling that he has a moral duty to act against Caesar and defend the Republic.As the conversation progresses, Cassius becomes more manipulative in his tactics. He knows that Brutus is vulnerable and that he wants to believe in the righteousness of the cause. So, he begins to appeal to Brutus’s emotions, pointing out the dangers that Caesar poses to their freedoms and the potential harm that he could bring to Rome. Cassius’s goal is to play on Brutus’s fears and anxieties, and he does so with great skill.Finally, Cassius uses a clever ruse to convince Brutus to join the conspirators. He employs a technique called “peripeteia,” which involves a sudden reversal of fortune or change in circumstances. Cassius stages a fake assassination attempt in which the conspirators plant fake letters in Brutus’s home, suggesting that the people of Rome are urging him to rise up against Caesar. This sudden shift in events convinces Brutus that the time is right for him to act, and he agrees to join the conspiracy.In conclusion, the meeting between Cassius and Brutus in Act 1, Scene 2 of Julius Caesar is a pivotal moment in the play. It sets the stage for the rest of the drama and marks the beginning of the conspiracy against Caesar. Cassius’s cunning use of persuasion and manipulation is what ultimately convinces Brutus to join the conspirators, demonstrating the power of language and the art of persuasion.",444,2152,1
gpt_25.txt,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, written by Ken Kesey and published in 1962, is a novel that has been both celebrated and criticized for its treatment of race and gender. The book follows the story of Randle McMurphy as he becomes a patient in a mental institution and challenges the authority of the head nurse, Nurse Ratched. Many have criticized the novel for its portrayal of women and people of color as subservient to the white male protagonist. However, it is important to consider the context of the time period in which the novel was written, as well as the societal and political issues that Kesey addresses through his writing.Firstly, it is important to address the issue of gender in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Nurse Ratched, the head nurse of the mental institution, is portrayed as a cold and calculating figure who is determined to maintain absolute control over her patients. Many critics argue that she represents the idea of a woman in power being dangerous and oppressive. However, it is important to consider the role of feminism during the time period in which the novel was written. Second-wave feminism, which focused on issues such as reproductive rights and workplace discrimination, was gaining popularity in the 1960s. Nurse Ratched can be seen as a representation of the patriarchal society that feminist activists were fighting against.Secondly, the novel has been criticized for its treatment of people of color. The only significant character of color in the novel is Chief Bromden, a Native American patient who is mostly silent and narrates the story from the margins. Some critics argue that Bromden is portrayed as a stereotype of the “noble savage” and that his characterization reinforces the idea of people of color as being less intelligent and subordinate to white people. However, it is important to acknowledge the historical context of Native American representation in literature. Indigenous people had been forcibly removed from their land, had their culture erased and had been subjected to genocide. The portrayal of Chief Bromden as a marginalized figure who resists assimilation can be seen as a critique of the treatment of Native Americans in American society.In conclusion, the criticism of Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest for its treatment of race and gender is not without merit. However, it is important to consider the contextual factors in which the novel was written in order to understand the themes and messages that Kesey was trying to convey. The novel can be seen as a critique of the patriarchal and racist society of the 1960s, and it is still relevant today as we continue to grapple with issues of gender and racial inequality.",449,2265,1
gpt_26.txt,"In his article, “Happiness is a Glass Half Empty,” Oliver Burkeman argues that the relentless pursuit of positive emotions and optimistic thinking is not the key to happiness. Rather, it is necessary to make peace with negative emotions and accept life’s uncertainty and imperfection. Burkeman’s central point is that by embracing the negative emotions, humans can cultivate resilience and experience deeper joy in life.One reason why Burkeman makes this argument is that our culture today is obsessed with positivity and optimism. He contends that this is because society has bought into the idea that the key to happiness is found in positivity. In contrast, Burkeman posits that accepting the inevitability of negative emotions is more beneficial in the long run. By embracing rather than suppressing them, we can move beyond them and become more resilient individuals.Burkeman backs up his arguments with specific evidence. For instance, he cites research by psychologist Julie Norem, who found that people who were pessimistic in their thinking were actually more successful in dealing with life’s challenges. Further, Burkeman notes that people who have experienced grief and other negative emotions have reported experiencing more meaning and purpose in life.Another piece of evidence Burkeman cites is research that indicates that individuals are more likely to be anxious when they strive for happiness. A psychology professor at New York University, Dr. Iris Mauss, found that people who pursued happiness actually felt worse about their lives overall. This conclusion supports Burkeman’s argument that ceaselessly pursuing happiness could lead to disappointment, anxiety, and an overall sense of dissatisfaction.Burkeman also looks at how our constant pursuit of happiness sets us up for failure. For instance, he notes that many individuals turn to consumerism or other types of consumption to fill the void of happiness. Yet, research indicates that acquiring material possessions does not lead to long-term happiness. Burkeman believes that our culture’s fixation on positivity and consumerism is leading to a hollow and superficial sense of joy.In sum, Burkeman’s article argues that the relentless pursuit of happiness is not a fruitful endeavor. By accepting negative emotions, humans can become more resilient and experience deeper joy in life. Burkeman makes this argument by using various pieces of evidence to support his claim. He contends that our culture’s obsession with positivity and consumerism does not lead to happiness. Rather, it is necessary to accept the inevitability of negative emotions and embrace them as part of the human experience.",405,2269,1
gpt_27.txt,"Atlas Cloud by David Mitchell is a novel featuring interconnected stories that provide insight into the lives of various individuals whose past actions set their future paths. The first four stories are interconnected in several ways that are essential to the development of the plot-lines. The narratives connect through themes of guilt, consequences, and redemption, and the connection feels essential to the individual plot-lines rather than gimmicky.The first story introduces us to Holly Sykes, who runs away from home at fifteen and seeks refuge at a nursing home, where she meets an old woman who gives her a mystical jade amulet to wear around her neck. The second story features Hugo Lamb, a wealthy student whose encounter with an OAP led to a mystical experience, after which he finds himself pursued by a vengeful creature. The third story focuses on Ed Brubeck, a retired reporter who embarks on a mission to expose a corrupt system while dealing with his daughter's untimely death. Finally, we meet Crispin Hershey, an aging writer whose career is in a free fall after a disastrous confrontation with a fellow author.The connection between the first four stories centers on the mystical jade amulet, which each of the main characters comes across at some point, either directly or indirectly. The amulet acts as a physical representation of guilt, leading to consequences and eventually redemption. Moreover, the characters' actions in one story follow them throughout the remaining narratives, which serves to enhance their relationships and responsibilities.Through the stories, Mitchell underscores several universal truths about the consequences of our choices and actions, including how the price of wrongdoing is paid both in this life and the next. The characters' experiences show that the price of redemption is steep and can only be obtained once one acknowledges their wrongdoing, faces the consequences, and tries to make amends.In conclusion, Mitchell's Atlas Cloud uses a masterful narrative technique to interlink the lives of the characters, creating detailed plot-lines that enable us to explore the connection between guilt, consequences, and redemption. The themes that link the stories are tied together elegantly, with each character serving as pieces of a bigger puzzle. The connection feels essential to the individual plot-lines, rather than gimmicky, highlighting the importance of the characters' actions, and the consequences that follow them. Atlas Cloud is a powerful reminder that we all have a responsibility to acknowledge our actions' consequences and work towards making amends for the greater good.",408,2240,1
gpt_28.txt,"In the novel Disgrace by J.M Coetzee, David Lurie, the main character, has a significant amount of power - both as a teacher and as a white man in Apartheid-era South Africa. However, he exploits his power in the novel's early going. In this essay, I will explore how David abuses his authority to exert his dominance and control over people around him, leading to his downfall.David, as a teacher, has the power to pass judgment on his students' work and decide their fate in academic and personal life. Initially, it is evident that he has no passion for teaching and uses his position only to boost his ego and fulfill his desires. He holds a cavalier attitude towards his position when he starts an affair with one of his students, Melanie Isaacs, who is more than half his age. David's relationship with Melanie is not only unethical, but also a complete betrayal of his power dynamic as a teacher. He uses his authority to force himself onto Melanie, who is powerless to resist David's advances.Apart from his power as a teacher, David also has tremendous influence as a white man in Apartheid-era South Africa. He exploits it too. For instance, when he goes to a committee to plead his case, he exercises his influence and gets his way. However, his tactic relies on his whiteness, as he even admits, ""A man like me… can make himself heard if he speaks loud enough."" He assumes that his white privilege and dominance will eternally remain intact in a country where the majority of the population is black, and this assumption has catastrophic consequences.David's exploitation of his power culminates in an event where he and his daughter, Lucy, are brutalized by three black men. This experience shatters his worldview as he realizes that his power has limits. David learns that society has changed, and the power dynamic that he has taken for granted has been upturned. His earlier behavior is the cause of his downfall as he is left grappling with the implications of what it means to have and wield power.In conclusion, David Lurie's abuse of his power - both as a teacher and as a white man - is central to the novel Disgrace. David's actions reveal how individuals can exploit their power to advance their personal agenda, but also the consequences of mistreating that power. Coetzee's work is a testament to how the exploitation of power leads to loss of morality, integrity, and ultimately, disgrace.",416,2000,1
gpt_29.txt,"Nature is a powerful force that can challenge and conquer even the most resilient of individuals. In both the novel, Into the Wild, by John Krauker, and the short story, “To Build a Fire,” by Jack London, nature serves as an unstoppable antagonist that crushes the protagonists' plans and ambitions. While both stories deal with characters who are determined to conquer nature, there are some significant differences in the way they approach this challenge, and how they ultimately succumb to it.The main character in Into the Wild is Christopher McCandless, who is fascinated by the idea of testing himself against the wilderness of Alaska. In contrast, the protagonist in “To Build a Fire” is an unnamed man motivated solely by greed. While McCandless seeks enlightenment and fulfillment, the man in “To Build a Fire” is driven solely by his desire to get rich. The nature that confronts these men is depicted as being indifferent to their intentions and motivations. It is a force that is beyond their control and can be deadly.The indomitable violence and strength of nature is palpable in both stories, as both protagonists are defeated by it. Despite his extensive preparation, McCandless is unable to survive the harsh Alaskan wilderness, and ultimately dies from starvation. The man in “To Build a Fire” fails to heed the warnings of the experienced men he encounters on his journey and is eventually killed as his hands become too numb to build a fire to save his life. The lessons to be learned from these defeats are both powerful and poignant. Firstly, neither protagonist had enough respect for the power of nature when they set out. They both made critical mistakes and paid for them with their lives. Secondly, both stories warn against the dangers of arrogance and pride, as well as highlighting the importance of humility and respect for one's surroundings. Finally, both works emphasize the insignificance of human life in the grand scheme of nature. Nature is indeed an antagonist in the stories, however, it is not malevolent or vengeful, but rather uncaring and indifferent. The stories portray nature as a force beyond human comprehension, and we as humans are simply insignificant beings in this world. Although nature in these stories is cruel, it is the cruelness of a machine, not a human being. In conclusion, both Into the Wild by John Krauker and “To Build a Fire” by Jack London portray the power and force of nature in a way that reminds the readers of the insignificance of our existence. Through the protagonist's tragic defeats, the stories caution against arrogance, pride, and lack of respect for nature's power. Ultimately, these works of literature serve as a warning to all those who seek to challenge the natural world.",459,2301,1
gpt_30.txt,"In J.M. Coetzee’s novel Disgrace, violence and oppression are central themes that shape the story and its characters. The novel portrays a society in which the power dynamics are unevenly skewed, with some individuals enjoying privileges at the expense of others. The author investigates the ways in which violence and oppression manifest themselves within the South African society, exposing how individuals embrace these practices to maintain their position in the society.At the center of the novel are David Lurie, a middle-aged professor at a university in Cape Town, and his daughter, Lucy, who survive a brutal attack on their farmstead by three black assailants. The attack is the epitome of the violence and oppression that plague the South African society, where black individuals are discriminated against and subject to economic marginalization. The attackers' motives are unclear, but the fact that they are black men attacking white people is symbolic and suggestive of the larger societal issues of racism and prejudice that exist in the novel's setting.David Lurie can be seen as the oppressor in the novel, representing the patriarchal white establishment that holds economic and political power. He exhibits this power dynamic in his sexually exploitative behavior towards women, particularly his affair with a student who instead of reporting the sexual misconduct was forced to resign from the university. Furthermore, his paternalistic attitude towards his daughter, Lucy, is invasive, oppressive and reinforces the power dynamic in their relationship, particularly when he disregards her independence and decision-making abilities.Lucy, on the other hand, exemplifies the oppressed. She is a woman living in a male-dominated society where her agency is limited and her safety precarious. The attack on her farmstead symbolizes the constant threat of violence that women face in their daily lives. Lucy's decision to stay on the farm after the attack, to work her own land, is a response to this disparity in society as she seeks to reclaim her agency and independence. Direct comparisons can be drawn between the power dynamics behind the attack and the sexual exploitation that occurs earlier in the novel. In both cases, the oppressors are exploiting their position of power to impose their will on others. Nevertheless, Lucy's experience of being attacked cannot be compared to David's exploitation of his position of power. The former experience was a traumatic and dehumanizing ordeal that lasted only a few moments, while the latter is an ongoing systemic issue.In conclusion, violence and oppression are central themes in Disgrace by J.M. Coetzee. The novel exposes the ways in which these tactics are employed to maintain power in the society. The oppressors and the oppressed are not clearly defined as characters in the novel, as both oppressors and oppressed are shown to exist in various categories. However, the author's depiction of these themes is compelling and serves as a commentary on the oppressive societal structures that exist within South African society.",481,2621,1
gpt_31.txt,"Barack Obama’s 2004 keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention is an excellent example of Aristotle's rhetorical situation as it effectively blends pathos, ethos, and logos to persuade the audience. In this essay, we will analyze how Obama's speech adheres to Aristotle's rhetorical situation through examining its text, authorship, audience, purpose, and setting.Firstly, the text of Obama's speech was a medium that aimed to convey his message to the convention's audience.

gpt_32.txt,"The call of the wild has always been a tempting invitation for those seeking adventure. It is no surprise, then, that the wilderness has a specific appeal for all the adventure seekers described in Jon Krakauer’s Into the Wild. The central character, Chris McCandless, is a quintessential adventurer who is drawn to the wild for various reasons. However, he is not the only one who finds solace in the wilderness. Throughout his journey, McCandless meets several other individuals who also seem to find the allure of the wilderness irresistible.For Chris McCandless, the wilderness represents freedom, escape from the shackles of society. McCandless was disillusioned by the materialistic lifestyle that he saw around him, and he yearned for a simpler, more authentic existence. The wilderness was his refuge - a place where he could live off the land and be free from the trappings of society. McCandless felt a sense of accomplishment and self-sufficiency as he learned to fend for himself in the wild, and the isolation afforded him a chance to clear his mind and put his life into perspective.However, McCandless was not the only one searching for a sense of fulfillment in the wilderness. Throughout his journey, he meets other travelers like Ron Franz, Jan Burres, and her boyfriend, Bob. Ron Franz, in particular, seems to be searching for a sense of purpose and belonging in the wild. His previous life, which involved a failed marriage and estrangement from his children, left him feeling lost and lonely. The wilderness serves as a way for him to escape his past and find a new lease on life.Similarly, Jan Burres and Bob had also traveled across the country in search of a different way of life. They found solace in selling trinkets on the road and living off the land, just like McCandless. The wilderness provides them with a sense of freedom and enables them to live life on their own terms, free of the constraints of society and societal norms.In Into the Wild, Jon Krakauer suggests that the appeal of the wilderness lies in the way it allows individuals to express their individuality. For McCandless, the wilderness represented an opportunity to shed his old life and be reborn as Alex Supertramp. He felt that he was no longer bound by societal expectations and could, instead, live in complete freedom. Others that he encountered along the way expressed similar sentiments, rejecting their old lives in search of something more fulfilling.In conclusion, for all adventure seekers described in Into the Wild, the wilderness has a specific appeal. For Chris McCandless, it was a chance to escape society and live a more authentic life, free from the material trappings of modernity. However, McCandless was not alone in this quest - others he met along the way were also searching for something more. The wilderness serves as a kind of spiritual home, allowing individuals to express their individuality, find themselves, and carve out a new sense of belonging.",494,2488,1
gpt_33.txt,"The novel “Into the Wild” by Jon Krakauer tells the true story of Christopher McCandless, a young man who abandoned his comfortable life to live off the land in the wilderness of Alaska. Overall, the protagonist has many qualities of a hero. However, it is up to interpretation whether these qualities are enough to make him a prototypical hero.Firstly, Christopher displays immense bravery in his journey. Leaving behind everything he knew and stepping out into the wild on his own takes a lot of courage, particularly as he had no prior experience or knowledge of how to survive off the land. This is a key quality that heroes are often known for - their bravery in the face of adversity. Christopher also continued to pursue his dream of living in the wilderness, even when he faced numerous obstacles, including hunger, cold weather, and the physical challenges of surviving on his own.Another quality that Christopher possesses is his determination. He never gave up on his dream, even when it became difficult. This determination and persistence show that he is willing to face challenges head-on and work towards his goals with unwavering commitment.However, Christopher also possesses some negative qualities, such as his stubbornness and his tendency to turn away from the help of others. These traits ultimately cause him harm and contribute to his untimely death. A prototypical hero is selfless and always willing to help others, but this is not the case with Christopher.In addition, Christopher’s lack of preparation for his journey shows a level of naivety that is often not associated with a hero. Although he had good intentions, he placed himself in danger by not being adequately equipped with the necessary knowledge and resources needed to survive in the wild. A typical hero would be expected to have some level of knowledge and preparation before embarking on such a perilous journey.In conclusion, Christopher McCandless displays many heroic qualities throughout the novel “Into the Wild,” including bravery and determination. However, his negative traits, lack of preparedness, and failure to help others prevent him from being a prototypical hero. While he may have met his untimely demise, McCandless' journey will continue to inspire readers to live life on their own terms and pursue their dreams with unyielding determination, while also serving as a warning of the dangers of reckless decisions.",389,2038,1

gpt_35.txt,"The novels, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce and the short story “Araby” both portray key moments in the coming-of-age of a young man. The formative events and movements in the lives of the protagonist, Stephen Dedalus in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and the unnamed narrator in “Araby” depict the journey of self-discovery, observation, and disillusionment in their respective lives. Both Stephen Dedalus and the narrator are portrayed as sensitive, imaginative and isolated individuals. Although there are similarities in their growth, both characters have different experiences, which sets them apart.In A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Joyce depicts the formative period in the life of Stephen Dedalus. Stephen is a young boy who grows up in a Catholic family and society, where religion, nationalism, and family values are highly regarded. Joyce portrays the early stages of Stephen's life through his family, school and church experiences. Stephen is initially very attached to his family and religious principles, but gradually he evolves and grows apart from them. The pivotal moment in Stephen's growth comes when he decides to leave Dublin to pursue his dreams of becoming an artist. Stephen's journey of self-discovery and attempt to reconcile secular art with his Catholic beliefs forms the central theme of the novel.Similarly, in the short story “Araby,” the narrator, a young boy, matures and gains perspective through his interactions with the world around him. From the beginning of the story, the boy exhibits a deep fascination with the bazaar. The bazaar symbolizes an escape from his mundane everyday life. However, the boy's infatuation with Mangan's sister leads him down a path of disillusionment. Like Stephen, the boy becomes disillusioned with the church and religion and develops a new perspective on morality and masculinity. The narrator realizes that he can never win Mangan's sister and that the bazaar is just a place of commercialism. The boy's realization marks a turning point in his growth and marks his transition to adulthood.The growth of both characters is similar in that they experience disillusionment with societal norms, tradition, and religion. Both Stephen and the narrator begin the stories in highly religious and traditional societies, and both end up alienating themselves from their surroundings. Both stories depict the loss of innocence and the realization of a harsh world, one that is devoid of beauty and hope, unlike the thoughts of the young protagonist.However, both stories also have significant differences. Stephen Dedalus’s journey in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is more intellectually driven and is more self-consciously artistic. Stephen's realization of his vocation to become an artist is a symbolic moment in the novel. He realizes that he needs to escape the restrictions of society to create his own art. In contrast, the narrator's realization in “Araby” is emotional-driven, and is not as abstract as Stephen's.

gpt_36.txt,"In Arthur Miller's play, ""Death of a Salesman,"" the motivations of the central characters are complex and interconnected. The four main characters are Willy Loman, a traveling salesman; his wife, Linda; and their two sons, Biff and Happy. Throughout the play, the motivations of each character become increasingly intertwined, leading to moments of tension, conflict, and deep emotion.Willy Loman's primary motivation is to achieve the American Dream of wealth, success, and popularity. He believes that being liked and popular is the key to success in business and life. He is desperate to be remembered and respected, and he is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve this goal, including lying and manipulating. Willy's fear of failure and his deep-seated insecurities drive him to cling to his delusions, and his inability to accept reality ultimately leads to his tragic downfall.Linda Loman's motivation is to protect her family. Throughout the play, she supports her husband, even when she knows he is lying to himself and his family. She is loyal to her family and constantly reminds them of the importance of their shared love and emotional connections. Linda's strength and resilience serve as a counterbalance to Willy's anxieties and insecurities.Biff Loman's motivation is to find his identity and purpose in life. He is struggling to find his place in the world and is haunted by his father's expectations. As a young man, Biff idolized his father, but as he grew older, he began to recognize Willy's faults and lies. Biff's disillusionment with his father and his own failures drive him to confront his past and seek a new path in life.Happy Loman's motivation is to live up to his father's expectations and succeed in business. Unlike Biff, Happy is content with his life and believes that he can achieve success by following his father's advice and tactics. He is willing to compromise his values to get ahead, and he is often blind to the flaws in his family and his own life.The motivations of the four central characters are intertwined and interconnected. Willy's fear of failure and his desperate desire for success and popularity drive him to cling to his delusions, which not only harm himself but also his family. Linda's loyalty to her family and her love for her husband are pitted against her realization that Willy's dreams are unrealistic and harmful. Biff and Happy's struggles with their own identity and their relationship with their father drive the plot and reveal the tragic consequences of the American Dream. Ultimately, the characters in ""Death of a Salesman"" are linked by their shared struggles and motivations, which ultimately lead to the play's tragic end.",442,2262,1
gpt_37.txt,"In the play Death of a Salesman, Willy Loman is portrayed as a tragic hero who ultimately meets an untimely end. While he may not fit the traditional definition of a martyr, his death serves a crucial purpose in the play and can be seen as a form of sacrifice. Willy's wife Linda and his sons Biff and Happy have differing interpretations of his death, with Linda lovingly remembering him as a man who did the best he could, while his sons struggle with the realization that he was not the successful man he always claimed to be.Firstly, it is important to consider what a martyr is and whether or not Willy Loman fits that description. A martyr is typically someone who dies for a cause or belief, often in a heroic or noble way. While Willy may not have died for a specific cause, his death can be seen as a sacrifice – he takes his own life in order to provide financial security for his family through his life insurance policy. Willy's suicide can be interpreted as a desperate attempt to ensure that his family is taken care of after he is gone, even if it means sacrificing his own life.Linda's interpretation of Willy's death is one of love and loyalty. She sees him as a hardworking man who always did the best he could and sacrificed everything for his family. Linda refuses to believe that Willy's death was a result of his own failures or shortcomings, instead choosing to remember him as a tragic hero who fought until the end. Linda's love and devotion to Willy are evident in her defense of him, even in death.Biff and Happy have a much different interpretation of their father's death. They struggle with the realization that their father was not the successful man he always claimed to be. Biff, in particular, feels betrayed by his father's lies and feels that he can never live up to the expectations that Willy had set for him. This realization is a major turning point for Biff, as he begins to question the value of the American Dream and the obsession with success that had consumed his family.In conclusion, Willy Loman's death can be seen as a form of sacrifice, although it may not fit the traditional definition of martyrdom. Linda and Willy's sons have contrasting interpretations of his death, with Linda remembering him lovingly as a tragic hero, while Biff and Happy struggle to come to terms with the reality of their father's life. Ultimately, Willy's death serves as a powerful commentary on the American Dream and the struggles of those who strive for success in a society that may not always reward hard work and dedication.",454,2107,1
gpt_38.txt,"In the novel In One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, the narrator, Chief Bromden, is an unreliable narrator who makes observations that are not always accurate. There are several instances in which his perceptions are skewed, particularly those related to his perception of McMurphy. Some reasons for Chief's unreliability include his mental illness, his drug use, and his fear of the hospital staff.Firstly, Chief Bromden's mental illness makes him an unreliable narrator. He suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, which affects his perceptions of reality. He often sees things that are not there and hears voices that no one else can hear. For example, he believes that the hospital is a mechanical and oppressive institution that controls its patients through a system of wires and machinery. This belief is not rooted in reality but rather in his delusions.Secondly, Chief Bromden's drug use contributes to his unreliability. Throughout the novel, he takes medication to control his mental illness. This medication has side effects that can alter his perceptions of reality. For instance, he experiences hallucinations and vivid dreams that blur the line between reality and fantasy. These experiences make it difficult for him to distinguish between what is real and what is not.Finally, Chief Bromden's fear of the hospital staff also makes him an unreliable narrator. He is constantly afraid of being caught and punished by the hospital staff, and this fear affects his perceptions of McMurphy. He sees McMurphy as a powerful and heroic figure who is standing up against the oppressive system of the hospital. However, this perception is colored by his fear of the staff and his desire to see a savior figure who can rescue him from his situation.In conclusion, Chief Bromden is an unreliable narrator who makes observations that are not always accurate. His mental illness, drug use, and fear of the hospital staff all contribute to his unreliability. In particular, his perception of McMurphy is colored by his desire for a savior and his fear of the staff. Therefore, readers should approach Chief's observations with caution and consider the context in which they are made.",348,1831,1

gpt_41.txt,"In his essay ""Happiness is a glass half empty,"" Oliver Burkeman argues that our cultural obsession with positivity and constantly chasing happiness is actually making us more miserable. He contends that embracing the negative aspects of life and practicing stoicism can lead to a more fulfilling and contented existence.Burkeman's central point is that the pursuit of happiness is a futile endeavor. He argues that our obsession with positive thinking and the belief that we can control our emotions is misguided. He believes that we should accept the inevitability of negative experiences and embrace them as part of the human condition. As he puts it, ""happiness inescapably involves negative experiences.""Burkeman supports his argument by citing the work of psychologist Gabriele Oettingen, who found that people who imagined positive outcomes for their life goals were actually less likely to achieve them. He also notes that the United States, a country that places a high value on happiness, has some of the highest rates of depression and anxiety in the world. Burkeman argues that by constantly striving for happiness, we set ourselves up for disappointment and unhappiness.In addition, Burkeman discusses the concept of ""negative visualization,"" a technique used in stoic philosophy to prepare for worst-case scenarios. He argues that by envisioning negative outcomes, we can better appreciate the good things in our lives and develop resilience. This technique has been shown to be effective in reducing anxiety and improving overall well-being.Finally, Burkeman cites research showing that people who engage in ""downward social comparison,"" or comparing themselves to those less fortunate, are happier than those who compare themselves to those who are more successful. This is because it allows individuals to appreciate what they have and feel grateful, rather than constantly striving for more.In conclusion, Burkeman's central point in ""Happiness is a glass half empty"" is that our obsession with positivity and happiness is misguided and can ultimately lead to more unhappiness. He supports this argument with evidence from psychology, philosophy, and social science research. Burkeman's purpose in making this argument is to encourage readers to embrace negativity and accept the imperfections of life for a more contented existence.",355,1996,1

The story is similar to other dystopian works in that it portrays an imagined future society that is oppressive and authoritarian.

gpt_43.txt,"Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell is a masterful novel that spans multiple timelines, genres, and settings, weaving together various narrative threads that ultimately culminate into a breathtaking masterpiece. Arguably the most fascinating aspect of this novel is the way in which the first four stories are interlinked and connected. It is through these connections that Mitchell shows the continuation of certain themes and ideas across time and space, ultimately creating a beautifully intricate web of ideas and symbols that make Cloud Atlas unforgettable.The thematic purpose of the connection between the first four stories is to show how these seemingly disparate tales are all interconnected, depicting the cyclical nature of human existence. At first glance, the stories appear to have nothing in common, but gradually, the reader begins to realize the similarities and connections between each one. For instance, in each narrative, the protagonist is fighting against some form of oppressive force, whether it be a person, corporation, or government. Additionally, each story explores the larger themes of power, love, and the meaning of existence.Moreover, Mitchell's impressive use of intertextuality is what makes each of these narratives feel essential to the overarching plotline of the novel. Characters, motifs, and themes are repeated throughout the stories, and by doing so, Mitchell extends the novel's themes across different periods of time. In this way, he creates his own form of literary intertextuality, which is unique to Cloud Atlas.Overall, Mitchell effectively connects each narrative to illustrate the oneness of humanity. His message is clear: while the settings and characters may change, there remains a cyclical nature to our existence that is beyond measure. By repeating themes, symbols, and motifs between each of the stories, Mitchell is able to create a sense of unity that permeates the entire novel. Ultimately, the connection between the stories of Cloud Atlas is not gimmicky but serves a grander purpose, presenting the reader with a unified vision of human existence that no single tale could ever accomplish on its own. Mitchell's interlinking of the first four stories is what makes Cloud Atlas not only a captivating read but also a profound examination of the human experience.",357,1967,1
gpt_44.txt,"Tennessee Williams’s play, A Streetcar Named Desire, is a brilliant interweaving of symbolism and metaphor which underlines the emotional journey of the central character Blanche DuBois. One of the recurring symbols used is the motif of light, which is employed to highlight the conflicts and contrasts that exist between the characters. By tracing its occurrence through the play, we can observe what this motif adds to the narrative and characterizations.The motif of light is used to describe the various characters in the play, suggesting their inner qualities and motivations. Blanche is described as having a ‘delicate beauty’, which is linked to lightness and purity. Stanley, on the other hand, is portrayed as rough, physical, and animalistic, contrasting with Blanche's elegance. This contrast is highlighted by the portrayal of light, with Blanche preferring subdued, indirect lighting while Stanley prefers bright, direct light.Furthermore, the motif of light is also used to illustrate the inner psychological states of the characters. Blanche has a deep-seated fear of darkness, which she associates with death and the loss of her sanity. She clings to the light, hoping that this will keep her mind ‘undarkened’. On the other hand, Stanley is threatened by the darkness as it represents the potential of losing control, hence, he prefers bright, artificial light to keep his space clearly defined and under his authority.The visual of the incoming searchlight foreshadows Blanche’s downfall. The scene where this occurs, Blanche is finally exposed, and the result of being bombarded by harsh light is in the form of mental breakdown. The searchlight illuminates her, both physically and psychologically while revealing her past to the police. To conclude, the motif of light is an essential device that enables the audience to gain insight into the characters' personalities and fates. The conflict between Blanche and Stanley is highlighted by their opposite tastes in light, and their different reactions to it represent their struggles for power and control. As a result, it adds a layer of meaning to the narrative. Its occurrence through the play gives readers a glimpse into the inner lives of the characters, serving as a powerful visual cue, and amplifying the themes of death, desire, and illusions that drive the plot of the play.",370,1986,1
gpt_45.txt,"In J.M. Coetzee's novel Disgrace, David Lurie is a middle-aged communications professor who exploits his power both as a teacher and as a white man in Apartheid-era South Africa. Through his actions and interactions with key players in the novel, particularly Melanie, Soraya, and Polley, the reader is able to gain insight into the ways in which Lurie abuses his power and privilege.Firstly, as a teacher, Lurie exploits his power over Melanie, one of his students. In the early stages of the novel, we see Lurie initiating an affair with Melanie despite the obvious power imbalance between them. Lurie is dismissive of Melanie's request to read Byron as part of the course material and soon thereafter, proceeds to initiate sexual contact with her. Moreover, he rationalizes his behavior by implying that Melanie is complicit in the relationship, leading to the notion that he is using his power as an older man and a teacher to take advantage of her.Secondly, as a white man, Lurie exploits his power over two women, Soraya and Polley, early in the novel. When visiting Soraya, his ex-wife, Lurie takes advantage of her hospitality by having sex with her. Lurie later reiterates his questionable motives by declaring that the sex is purely physical and that he has no intentions of returning back to Soraya as a partner. Similarly, when Lurie meets Polley about getting his daughter Lucy's dog, he uses his position as a customer to make advances towards her, grooming her into a possible sexual encounter in the future.Overall, Lurie's exploitation of his power as a white man and a professor in Apartheid-era South Africa highlights the inequalities that existed during that time period. The power imbalance between Lurie and Melanie, as well as his earlier behavior with Soraya and Polley, suggest that Lurie views women as objects who are there for his disposal. In conclusion, David Lurie's exploitation of his power in Disgrace serves as a typical example of the kind of complex issues at play in South Africa during that time period. Through his actions, Coetzee's work presents several resonant questions regarding power, race, gender, and responsibility that are still relevant to readers today.",361,1847,1
gpt_46.txt,"David's decision to step down from his teaching position is based on a flawed assumption that Melanie reciprocates his feelings. His irrational behavior was clouded by infatuation, leading him to believe that Melanie felt the same way. However, Melanie's decision to file a complaint against David brings him back to reality, realizing the gravity of his actions. The prospect of facing charges and being labeled as a sexual predator is too much for David to bear, leading him to abandon his profession altogether.David's disillusionment is evident in his thoughts as he contemplates the repercussions of his actions. He understands that the intimacy they once shared is now gone, replaced by animosity and legal wrangling. The notion that Melanie, who was once his lover, is now his accuser is a clear indication of the serious nature of the charges against him. David's decision to step down from his teaching position may be viewed as a wise one, given the seriousness of the charges against him. His focus now should be on clearing his name and proving his innocence. His actions, though misguided, should not prevent him from fulfilling his professional responsibilities in the future. As an essay writer, I would suggest that David seeks counseling to address any underlying issues that may have contributed to this unfortunate situation. Additionally, he should take active steps to rebuild his reputation and restore his professional standing.",232,1220,1
gpt_47.txt,"In the context of knowledge as justified true belief, there is an argument to be made for the establishment of a new form of knowledge. This new form of knowledge, which I believe many are still unaware of, is the practice of digital minimalism.Digital minimalism is a philosophy that advocates for the intentional use of technology only in instances where it serves a specific purpose, rather than allowing it to take up a significant portion of our time and attention without any meaningful benefit. It entails breaking away from the constant need for digital stimulation and learning to cultivate more meaningful relationships, experiences, and pursuits in the physical world.The justification for this belief stems from the increasing prevalence of addiction to technology and the negative impact it has on our mental and physical health. Studies have shown that excessive use of digital devices can increase levels of anxiety and depression and lead to a lack of focus and productivity.In contrast, digital minimalism has been proven to reduce stress and increase well-being. It also promotes better time management, which allows for more time to pursue meaningful hobbies and interests, as well as more face-to-face interactions with loved ones.Moreover, digital minimalism is not a practice aimed at completely eradicating technology from our lives but rather establishing a healthy relationship with it. By limiting our use, we can better appreciate the benefits that technology does provide without its harmful effects.In conclusion, the digital age has brought about many positive changes to our lives, but it has also led to detrimental effects on our well-being. The establishment of digital minimalism as a form of knowledge is, therefore, necessary to ensure a healthier relationship between humans and technology. By adopting this practice, we can lead more fulfilling lives and be more connected to the world around us.",302,1634,1
gpt_48.txt,"Suicide has become a major concern among teenagers in recent years. Despite efforts by parents, schools, and mental health professionals to prevent it, suicide continues to be one of the leading causes of death among adolescents. This essay will explore some of the reasons why a teenager may commit suicide, as well as various methods of preventing suicide in teens.One of the most significant reasons why teenagers may commit suicide is the feeling of being overwhelmed by life. Adolescence is a time of transition, characterized by changes in physical, emotional, and social development. Teenagers are expected to manage pressures from family, peers, and school while trying to develop their own sense of identity. For some, the challenges of navigating through these changes can be too much to handle. In some cases, the death of a loved one, physical or emotional abuse, or a traumatic event can trigger suicidal thoughts or behavior.Another reason for suicidal tendencies in teens is frustration and depression arising from severe bullying or cyberbullying. Social media platforms or the internet, in general, can be a breeding ground for bullying and abusive behavior. Teenagers who are subjected to constant ridicule and belittlement may feel isolated and helpless, which, in turn, can lead to thoughts of suicide.There are many methods of preventing suicide in teenagers. One of the most effective is early intervention, where mental health professionals work with teenagers to identify and address any mental health issues early on. Parents can also play a crucial role in preventing suicide by maintaining open lines of communication with their teenagers, and by remaining vigilant for any signs of suicidal thoughts or behavior.Schools and communities can also play a vital role in the prevention of suicide. Schools can establish counseling services and support groups for students who are struggling with mental health issues or who have experienced trauma. Community organizations can also provide support programs and resources for teenagers who are feeling overwhelmed or isolated. Finally, educating teenagers on the dangers of suicide and providing them with strategies to cope with stress, anxiety and depression can go a long way in preventing suicide. Programs such as awareness workshops, suicide prevention hotlines and social media campaigns can help teenagers understand the gravity of the situation and how to get the help they need.In conclusion, suicide among teenagers continues to be a significant problem in today's society. Understanding the underlying reasons for suicidal tendencies and finding effective ways to prevent it can help save lives. By providing education, support, and resources to teenagers and establishing programs to promote mental health, we can work towards a future where suicide is no longer a cause of death among adolescents.",444,2440,1
gpt_49.txt,"In his song ‘i’, Kendrick Lamar explores his experience of growing up in Compton, one of the most violent and gang-afflicted neighborhoods in Los Angeles. The song reveals the inner turmoil that Lamar struggled with as he wrestled with his identity as a member of the community and as an individual seeking to transcend the violence and negativity around him. Through the lyrics of ‘i’, Lamar employs symbols and patterns to portray his experience of growing up in Compton, as well as his determination to rise above it.One symbol that Lamar uses frequently in the song is the image of a gun. This symbol represents the violence that was a constant presence in his life, both in the gang-affiliated violence that plagued his community and in the police brutality that he witnessed. The repeated refrain “I love myself” can be seen as a response to this symbol, as Lamar seeks to affirm his own worth and identity in the face of the violence around him. He also declares that he has chosen not to carry a weapon himself, suggesting that he has moved beyond the need to rely on violence for protection.Another key theme in ‘i’ is that of memory, particularly in relation to Lamar’s childhood experiences. He recalls being bullied and beaten up as a child, and the pain and frustration he felt at the time. However, he also acknowledges that these experiences have shaped him in important ways, helping him to develop resilience and determination, and inspiring him to pursue his passion for music as a means of expressing his experiences and emotions.The pattern of struggle and redemption is also evident in Lamar’s lyrics. He acknowledges the difficulties of growing up in Compton, but also celebrates his ability to transcend this environment through his music. The line “I done been through a whole lot/Trial, tribulation, but I know God/Satan wanna put me in a bow-tie” suggests that Lamar has faced many challenges on his road to success, but he has overcome these obstacles through his faith and his commitment to his art.Overall, ‘i’ reveals Kendrick Lamar’s complex relationship with his hometown of Compton, as well as his determination to rise above the violence and negativity that has characterized that community.

gpt_50.txt,"The wilderness holds a distinctive appeal to the various adventure-seekers in Jon Krakauer's Into the Wild. The primary character Chris McCandless, as well as the diverse group of individuals he encounters on his journey, share a fascination and deep appreciation for the natural world. In particular, McCandless is enthralled by the raw, unadulterated essence of nature, and it is this aspect of the wilderness that draws him towards it.First of all, McCandless's obsession with the wilderness is reflective of the romantic philosophy that he embraces. Similar to Transcendentalism, a literary and philosophical movement that emphasized the importance of personal integrity and living in harmony with nature, McCandless believes that nature offers salvation from societal ills. He deeply desires to experience nature in its rawest form, to get away from the corrupt, materialistic world he feels oppressed by, and to be in touch with his primitive spirit. McCandless's romanticized view of the natural world is evocative of his desire to escape from the hypocrisy of materialism.Moreover, McCandless's enduring love for the wilderness is also an acknowledgement of his autonomous lifestyle. He prefers to be self-reliant and free from the constraints of civilisation. McCandless chooses to embark on his journey with equipment that would be considered inadequate by regular adventurists, as he wants to fully embrace the inherent risks of living off the land. He believes that facing these challenges of survival will make him stronger and enhance his connection with the environment. This appreciation for self-sufficiency is something that he shares with other characters in the novel like Wayne Westerberg, and Ron Franz, who are themselves seeking lives of freedom and independency.Lastly, the wilderness holds a spiritual and transformative appeal for McCandless. When confronted by Alaska's beauty, McCandless experiences a change in his perception and transforms into a new person. His innermost psyche is touched and stirred by the magnificence and brutality of nature. He cherishes the wilderness's power to transform him by humbling him in ways that he never thought possible. This transformative quality of the wilderness is something that he shares with other characters in the novel. For instance, Ronald Franz and Gene Rossellini try to find solace in the wilderness following personal difficulties and crisis.In conclusion, Chris McCandless's deep appreciation for the wilderness is grounded in his belief in the power of nature to rekindle the basic human spirit. As depicted in Krakauer's Into the Wild, the wilderness holds a profound adventurous appeal, not just to McCandless but also other characters he meets along the way. Different characters may have their reasons for seeking the wilds, but the underlying commonality among them is the wilderness's transformative power to alter their being.",443,2476,1
gpt_51.txt,"Nature is a formidable force that is both beautiful and unforgiving. John Krauker’s novel Into the Wild and Jack London’s short story “To Build a Fire” portray the indomitable violence and strength of nature. These two works of literature depict the power of nature and how it conquers the main characters. This essay will compare and contrast both stories, analyze how nature defeats both protagonists, and the lessons that can be learned from their tragic endings.The main characters in these two stories are Chris McCandless in Into the Wild and the unnamed protagonist in “To Build a Fire.” Both McCandless and the protagonist are self-reliant, determined, and adventurous. They both enter the wilderness at the start of their respective journeys with a desire to conquer nature and challenge themselves.However, nature proves to be too powerful for both characters, and they meet their untimely deaths. McCandless dies in the Alaskan wilderness after a series of unfortunate events, while the protagonist in “To Build a Fire” dies from hypothermia when he fails to build a fire to keep himself warm. In both cases, nature serves as the antagonist in these stories, showcasing its dominance over human beings.The lessons to be learned from these stories are the importance of respecting nature and the consequences of underestimating its power. The characters' lack of preparation, knowledge, and respect for nature leads to their demise. Nature is not to be taken lightly, and it demands our utmost attention, respect, and preparation. Failure to do so can lead to devastating consequences, such as losing one's life.In conclusion, the stories of Into the Wild and “To Build a Fire” convey the power of nature and the consequences of underestimating its strength. The main characters' defeats and tragic endings serve as a cautionary tale not to take nature for granted and the importance of having respect for it. While nature can be beautiful and awe-inspiring, it also has the power to conquer even the strongest and most self-reliant individuals. It is necessary to prepare and respect nature if we desire to explore and survive within it.",347,1802,1
gpt_52.txt,"In J.M Coetzee's acclaimed novel, Disgrace, the themes of violence and oppression are central to the narrative. Set in post-apartheid South Africa, the novel depicts a society struggling to come to terms with its history of racial division and inequality. Through his portrayal of the protagonists' experiences, Coetzee explores the complexities of the power dynamics at play in a society ravaged by white colonialism and systemic racism. This essay will argue that the line between oppressors and oppressed in Disgrace is not always clear, as both the beneficiaries and the victims of past injustices are implicated in the cycle of violence that characterises South Africa's transition to democracy.One of the most striking aspects of Disgrace is that the protagonist, David Lurie, is himself implicated in the system of oppression that has shaped South Africa's history. As a white, male academic, he occupies a position of privilege and power that has been built on the exploitation and subjugation of people of colour. Throughout the novel, Lurie repeatedly refuses to acknowledge his complicity in this system. He is dismissive of the concerns of his black students, who feel marginalized and belittled by his teaching style. He is also sexually predatory, using his position of authority to engage in an affair with a young, black woman who works at the university. Lurie's actions are thus emblematic of the broader role played by white colonists in exploiting and oppressing people of colour.On the other hand, the novel also depicts the ongoing suffering of black South Africans, who have been systematically disenfranchised and excluded from political and economic power. The character of Lucy Lurie, David's daughter, serves to highlight the violence that is often inflicted on black women in contemporary South Africa. After being attacked and raped by a group of violent intruders, Lucy is left traumatized and vulnerable. Her experience is indicative of the broader culture of violence that characterizes a society still grappling with the legacy of oppression. Similarly, Petrus, the black farmer who works on Lucy's land, is torn between his eagerness to succeed in a society that has denied him opportunities and his loyalty to his community and its cultural traditions.However, it is also worth noting that Disgrace does not present a simplistic binary opposition between oppressors and oppressed. Rather, the novel portrays a complex web of power relations that implicate both black and white South Africans in acts of violence and oppression. For example, Lucy's attitude towards Petrus oscillates between paternalism and hostility, reflecting the ways in which members of both communities can be complicit in the subjugation of others. Similarly, the attack on Lucy can be read as a manifestation of the anger and resentment felt by black South Africans who feel excluded from the benefits of post-apartheid society. Thus, the line between oppressors and oppressed is blurred, as both groups are implicated in the violence and oppression that characterizes contemporary South Africa.In conclusion, Disgrace offers a nuanced portrayal of the violence and oppression that continue to shape South African society. Through its depiction of characters who occupy both privileged and marginalized positions, the novel highlights the complex web of power relations at play in post-apartheid South Africa. While the line between oppressors and oppressed is not always clear, the novel emphasizes the need for all members of South African society to acknowledge the ongoing implications of past injustices and to work towards a more just and equitable future.",570,3102,1
gpt_53.txt,"Ernest Hemingway's short story, ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" is a tale about an old Cuban fisherman named Santiago and his journey to catch a giant marlin. Despite his efforts, he faces numerous obstacles including the sharks that attack his catch. The old man faces immense physical and emotional challenges throughout the story and his biggest test is when he fights the sharks. In this essay, I will argue that although the old man faces a tough defeat against the sharks, he is not defeated.In the beginning, Santiago is depicted as a man who is struggling with disappointment and the feeling of being defeated. He has not caught a fish in 84 days and has been continuously mocked by his peers for his poor fishing skills. However, Santiago refuses to give up on his dream and sets out to catch a marlin. After days of waiting, he finally succeeds in catching the giant fish. Despite being attacked by the sharks, Santiago remains relentless in his efforts to bring the catch ashore. This is evident when he battles the sharks with his harpoon and knife. Even though he is unable to save his catch, he refuses to give up and continues fighting until the end.In the final scene, Santiago is exhausted, bruised, and beaten by the sharks but he still finds the courage to make his way home. He may not have the fish with him but he is contented with the knowledge that he fought until the end and never gave up. This shows that even though he faced defeat in his quest to catch the fish, the old man was not defeated.In conclusion, the old man in Ernest Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea"" is not defeated at the end of the story. Despite losing his prized catch to the sharks, Santiago is still determined to continue living his life. He has proven that he is a man that cannot be defeated no matter how difficult the challenges. Therefore, the essence of the story lies not in whether or not he caught the fish, but rather in the journey he took to get there and the lessons he learned along the way.",365,1639,1
gpt_54.txt,"In Jon Krakauer’s novel, Into The Wild, Christopher McCandless is portrayed as a hero with unique qualities that set him apart from traditional figures of heroism. Although Christopher may not fit the conventional criteria of a hero, his nonconformity, bravery, and selflessness make him worthy of the title.Firstly, Christopher exemplifies nonconformity. He chooses to live a life that is unconventional, rejecting many of the values and traditions associated with modern society. Throughout the novel, Krakauer describes how Christopher longed to escape the constraints and pressures of his privileged upbringing in suburban Virginia and to experience a more profound connection with himself and with nature. His decision to leave all material possessions, cut ties with his family and friends, and venture out into the Alaskan wilderness on his own is a clear example of his nonconformist nature. This trait is a critical characteristic of a hero, as it takes considerable courage to stand up against the norm and to follow one's heart instead.Secondly, Christopher exhibits bravery throughout the novel. His adventure into the unknown leaves him vulnerable to harsh environmental conditions, starvation, and physical harm. Despite these challenges, Christopher pushes on. As documented in the book, Christopher traversed rugged terrain, crossed through the dangerous rapids of the Colorado River, and even slept alone in the woods with nothing but a sleeping bag. All the while, his brave and adventurous spirit never failed. His exceptional endurance and resiliency in his quest for self-discovery are admirable qualities of heroism.Lastly, Christopher possesses an innate selflessness that proves his heroic nature. Throughout his journey, he encounters people who become an important part of his life, and at times, jeopardize the very ideals he seeks to live by. Despite strong temptation, Christopher chooses not to compromise his beliefs and values. He instead chooses to remain true to his character and convictions.  His altruistic decision to offer his resources and companionship to those he meets on his journey, ultimately led to his own tragic and untimely end. An act of selflessness that is indicative of a hero.In conclusion, while Christopher McCandless may not conform to the traditional standards of a hero, his unique qualities of nonconformity, bravery, and selflessness undoubtedly make him a prototypical hero. He sets his own standards for a meaningful existence, living his life on his terms with determination and courage. The example Christopher sets in Into The Wild can serve as a model for anyone seeking fulfillment and meaning in their lives despite the challenges they may face.",416,2300,1
gpt_55.txt,"Umberto Eco's essay ""Ur-Fascism"" defines fascism as a complex ideology that arises from an individual or group's need for unity, authority, and tradition. Eco notes that fascism typically presents itself as a ""third way"" between capitalism and communism, and as such, often draws upon elements of both ideologies. Eco also identifies more specific features of fascism, such as the rejection of critical thinking and the elevation of emotion over reason, the emphasis on the superiority of one's own race or nation, the cultivation of a cult of heroism and violence, and the use of propaganda and censorship to create a sense of unity and control. Overall, Eco argues that fascism is a dangerous and insidious ideology that poses a threat to democracy and individual freedoms.",125,651,1

gpt_58.txt,"A fish would be more efficient at passing on energy to the next trophic level compared to a mammal. This is because fish are cold-blooded animals, which means they do not need to use energy to regulate their body temperature. Therefore, when fish consume food, more of the energy obtained from the food is available to be passed on to the next level. Additionally, fish have a simpler digestive system compared to mammals, which allows for a more efficient conversion of food into energy. On the other hand, mammals use energy to maintain their body temperature, have a more complex digestive system, and need to use energy to support their larger body mass, resulting in a lower efficiency in transferring energy to the next trophic level.",126,615,1
